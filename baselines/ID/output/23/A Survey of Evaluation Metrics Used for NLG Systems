For example, NLG can be used to generate sports recaps, weather updates, and stock market analyses, ensuring that critical information reaches a broader audience in a timely manner. Furthermore, in educational contexts, NLG systems can create customized learning materials and feedback, catering to diverse learning needs and styles. This personalized approach not only enhances student engagement but also supports inclusive education by accommodating learners with varying levels of proficiency and comprehension [1].

Despite their numerous benefits, NLG systems face several challenges that must be addressed to fully realize their potential. One significant challenge is the development of robust evaluation metrics that accurately assess the quality and effectiveness of generated text. Traditional evaluation methods often rely heavily on automated metrics, which may fail to capture the nuances and complexities of natural language. As highlighted by [16], the subjective nature of human judgments and the variability across different domains pose additional hurdles in evaluating NLG systems comprehensively. Consequently, there is a growing need for hybrid evaluation approaches that integrate both automated and human assessments to ensure a more holistic evaluation framework.

In light of these challenges, ongoing research is focused on developing more sophisticated evaluation techniques that can effectively measure the performance of NLG systems. This includes exploring novel metrics that account for factors such as semantic coherence, context-awareness, and emotional impact.

Such advancements are crucial for advancing the field of NLG and ensuring that these systems continue to meet the evolving demands of modern computing environments.

In summary, NLG systems are of paramount importance in modern computing due to their ability to automate data-driven text generation, enhance personalized user experiences, and democratize access to information. However, the effective deployment of NLG technologies hinges on the availability of reliable evaluation metrics that can accurately gauge their performance. As the field continues to evolve, addressing these evaluation challenges will be essential for unlocking the full potential of NLG systems across a variety of applications.
#### Overview of Existing Evaluation Metrics
The field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) has seen significant advancements over the past few decades, driven by the increasing demand for automated text generation across various domains such as healthcare, finance, journalism, and customer service. As NLG systems become more sophisticated and widely adopted, the need for robust evaluation metrics becomes paramount. These metrics serve as critical tools for assessing the performance, effectiveness, and reliability of NLG models. However, the landscape of evaluation metrics is complex and multifaceted, reflecting the diverse nature of NLG tasks and the evolving requirements of modern applications.

Existing evaluation metrics for NLG can be broadly categorized into quantitative, qualitative, and task-specific metrics, each addressing different aspects of system performance. Quantitative metrics often rely on statistical measures and linguistic features to provide objective assessments of generated text. For instance, metrics like BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR compare the overlap between generated texts and human-generated references, providing scores based on n-gram precision and recall [1]. While these metrics have been widely used, they face limitations in capturing semantic coherence and fluency, which are crucial for high-quality NLG outputs. To address these shortcomings, researchers have proposed more sophisticated metrics that incorporate deeper linguistic analysis, such as those based on parse trees and dependency structures [7].

Qualitative metrics, on the other hand, emphasize subjective judgments and human perception of the generated text. These metrics typically involve human evaluators who assess the readability, relevance, and naturalness of the output. While qualitative assessments offer valuable insights into the overall quality of NLG systems, they are inherently subjective and can vary significantly across different evaluators and contexts. Furthermore, the scalability of qualitative evaluations poses a significant challenge, especially when dealing with large datasets or real-time applications [16]. To mitigate this issue, hybrid approaches combining human and automated evaluations have been explored, aiming to leverage the strengths of both methods while mitigating their respective weaknesses [19].

Task-specific metrics represent another important category within the evaluation framework, tailored to the unique requirements of particular NLG applications. For example, in medical diagnosis support systems, metrics might focus on the accuracy and comprehensibility of generated reports, ensuring that the information provided is both clinically relevant and understandable to healthcare professionals [31]. Similarly, in financial statement analysis, metrics could prioritize the clarity and precision of generated summaries, helping analysts to quickly grasp key financial trends and insights [41]. The development of task-specific metrics underscores the importance of domain-specific knowledge in evaluating NLG systems, highlighting the need for context-aware assessment frameworks that can adapt to the diverse needs of different application areas.

In recent years, there has been a growing emphasis on developing composite metrics that integrate multiple dimensions of NLG performance, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of system capabilities. Composite metrics often combine quantitative and qualitative assessments, offering a balanced view of both objective measurements and subjective perceptions. For instance, some composite metrics incorporate elements of linguistic analysis, semantic similarity, and user satisfaction, providing a holistic assessment of NLG outputs [24]. Additionally, temporal and contextual metrics have gained attention, particularly in scenarios where the timing and context of generated text play a crucial role in its effectiveness. These metrics consider factors such as the relevance of information over time and the appropriateness of generated text in specific situational contexts, enhancing the practical applicability of NLG systems in dynamic environments [55].

Despite the progress made in developing evaluation metrics, several challenges remain. One major concern is the subjectivity inherent in human judgments, which can introduce variability and bias into the evaluation process. Efforts to standardize and validate human assessments through consistency checks and reliability tests have shown promise but continue to be an active area of research [16]. Another challenge lies in the variability of performance across different domains and tasks, necessitating the development of domain-specific metrics that can accurately reflect the nuances of specific applications [31]. Additionally, scalability issues persist, particularly in the context of large-scale NLG systems where manual evaluations become impractical. Innovative solutions, such as the use of machine learning algorithms for automated assessment, are being explored to address these scalability concerns [12].

Moreover, the handling of out-of-distribution data presents a significant challenge, as NLG systems often struggle to generate coherent and meaningful text when faced with inputs that deviate from the training distribution [19]. Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in NLG evaluations is also crucial, given the potential impact of biased assessments on the development and deployment of NLG technologies [55]. Finally, the integration of multimodal evaluation techniques, which consider visual and auditory cues alongside textual outputs, represents a promising direction for advancing NLG evaluation methods [24]. By addressing these challenges and exploring new evaluation paradigms, researchers and practitioners can enhance the reliability and effectiveness of NLG systems, paving the way for more widespread adoption and innovation in this rapidly evolving field.
#### The Evolution of Evaluation Techniques for NLG
The evolution of evaluation techniques for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems has been a dynamic process, reflecting the advancements and challenges inherent in the field of artificial intelligence. Initially, NLG evaluation was largely focused on assessing the grammatical correctness and syntactic structure of generated text. Early metrics were primarily quantitative, such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy), which measures the overlap between machine-generated texts and human reference texts [7]. However, this approach was soon found to be inadequate for capturing the semantic richness and coherence of NLG outputs. As NLG systems began to generate more complex and contextually relevant narratives, the need for more sophisticated evaluation methods became apparent.

One significant shift in the evolution of NLG evaluation techniques came with the realization that automated metrics alone could not fully capture the nuances of natural language. Automated metrics based on linguistic features, such as ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), were developed to address some of these limitations [7]. These metrics considered not only the presence of specific words but also their order and the structure of sentences, providing a more comprehensive assessment of textual quality. However, even these improvements fell short when it came to evaluating the semantic similarity and meaning conveyed by NLG outputs. To bridge this gap, researchers introduced metrics that focused specifically on semantic similarity, such as METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) and WMD (Word Moverâ€™s Distance) [7]. These metrics aimed to measure how closely the meaning of generated text aligns with human reference texts, thereby offering a more holistic view of NLG performance.

As NLG systems continued to evolve, so did the evaluation techniques used to assess them. Novelty and diversity became critical aspects of NLG output, leading to the development of metrics that could quantify these qualities. Metrics like Perplexity and Self-BLEU were introduced to evaluate the diversity and novelty of generated text [19]. These metrics assessed whether NLG systems could produce varied and innovative responses, rather than simply reproducing known patterns. Additionally, composite metrics emerged, combining multiple evaluation criteria to provide a more comprehensive assessment of NLG performance. For instance, metrics like BLEURT (BLEU-Robustness Test) were designed to be more robust against various types of errors and to better reflect human judgments [7].

However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain in accurately assessing NLG performance. One of the most pressing issues is the variability in human judgments, which can significantly impact the reliability and consistency of evaluations [16]. Another challenge lies in the scalability of evaluation processes, particularly when dealing with large datasets or real-time applications. Traditional evaluation methods often struggle to handle the volume and complexity of data generated by modern NLG systems efficiently [31]. Furthermore, ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in NLG evaluation remains a critical concern. Biased training data or evaluation criteria can lead to unfair assessments and perpetuate existing biases in the system [55].

To address these challenges, there has been a growing interest in hybrid evaluation approaches that integrate both automated and human evaluations. These hybrid methods aim to leverage the strengths of each type of evaluation while mitigating their respective weaknesses [16]. For example, automated metrics can quickly process large volumes of data, while human evaluations provide insights into the semantic and contextual accuracy of generated text [7]. However, implementing hybrid approaches effectively requires careful consideration of the context and domain-specific requirements of NLG systems. Researchers have begun to explore adaptive hybrid methods that can adjust their evaluation strategies based on the specific characteristics of the NLG task at hand [19].

In conclusion, the evolution of evaluation techniques for NLG systems reflects a continuous effort to develop more accurate and comprehensive methods for assessing NLG performance. From early quantitative metrics focused on grammatical correctness to more sophisticated approaches that consider semantic similarity and diversity, the field has seen significant progress. Nevertheless, ongoing challenges related to human judgment variability, scalability, and bias mitigation necessitate further innovation in evaluation methodologies. As NLG systems continue to advance and find new applications across diverse domains, the development of robust and fair evaluation techniques will remain a critical area of research and practice [35].
#### Challenges in Accurately Assessing NLG Performance
Accurately assessing the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems presents a multifaceted challenge that extends beyond traditional evaluation metrics used in other areas of natural language processing (NLP). One of the primary difficulties lies in the subjective nature of human judgments, which can significantly impact the reliability and consistency of evaluations [16]. Unlike tasks such as Named Entity Recognition (NER) or Part-of-Speech tagging, where objective criteria can be clearly defined, NLG evaluations often rely heavily on human reviewers to gauge the quality of generated text. This introduces variability due to individual biases, preferences, and contextual understanding, making it challenging to achieve uniform standards across different evaluators.

Another significant challenge is the variability observed across different domains and applications of NLG systems [31]. What constitutes high-quality output in one domain may not necessarily translate to another. For instance, the criteria for evaluating a medical diagnosis support system would differ markedly from those used for automated report generation or customer service chatbots. This domain-specificity complicates the development of universally applicable evaluation metrics, necessitating a tailored approach that accounts for the unique requirements and constraints of each application area. Additionally, the evolving nature of NLG techniques further exacerbates this issue, as new methods continually emerge, each with its own set of strengths and weaknesses that must be carefully assessed.

Scalability issues represent yet another hurdle in the accurate assessment of NLG performance [12]. Traditional evaluation methodologies often struggle to handle large datasets efficiently, particularly when multiple evaluators are involved. As NLG systems generate increasingly voluminous outputs, the manual review process becomes impractical and time-consuming. This limitation highlights the need for automated evaluation tools capable of handling vast amounts of data while maintaining accuracy and reliability. However, current automated metrics frequently fall short in capturing nuanced aspects of language generation, leading to a reliance on hybrid approaches that combine automated and human assessments. While promising, these hybrid methods introduce their own set of challenges, such as ensuring consistency between automated scores and human judgments and addressing potential biases introduced by the automation process.

Handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data poses an additional layer of complexity in NLG evaluation [19]. OOD data refers to inputs or scenarios that lie outside the training distribution of an NLG model, presenting situations the model has not encountered during its learning phase. These cases can severely test the robustness and generalization capabilities of NLG systems, highlighting limitations in their ability to produce coherent and contextually appropriate responses. Evaluating OOD performance requires careful consideration of how well a system adapts to novel inputs, which is crucial for real-world deployment. However, existing evaluation frameworks often overlook this aspect, focusing instead on in-distribution performance metrics. This gap underscores the importance of incorporating OOD testing into standard evaluation practices to provide a more comprehensive assessment of NLG system capabilities.

Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in NLG evaluations is another critical challenge [55]. Biases can arise at various stages of the evaluation process, from the selection of evaluation datasets to the interpretation of results. For example, if the dataset used for evaluation disproportionately represents certain demographic groups or linguistic styles, the resulting metrics may not accurately reflect the systemâ€™s performance across diverse user populations. Moreover, the subjective nature of human evaluations can inadvertently introduce biases, influencing the perceived quality of generated text. Addressing these issues requires a concerted effort to develop unbiased datasets, implement fair evaluation protocols, and continuously monitor and adjust metrics to ensure they are inclusive and representative. This ongoing process is essential for building trust in NLG systems and ensuring they serve all users equitably.

In summary, accurately assessing NLG performance involves navigating a complex landscape of challenges, from subjective human judgments and domain-specific variability to scalability issues and the handling of OOD data. These hurdles underscore the need for innovative evaluation strategies that combine the strengths of both automated and human assessments while addressing inherent biases and ensuring fairness. By acknowledging and proactively addressing these challenges, researchers and practitioners can develop more robust and reliable evaluation frameworks that truly capture the full spectrum of NLG system capabilities.

#### *Components of NLG Systems*
Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems are complex computational frameworks designed to convert structured data into human-readable text. These systems are integral to various applications ranging from automated report generation to customer service chatbots. Understanding the components that make up an NLG system is crucial for evaluating their performance effectively. An NLG system typically comprises several key components: data input, knowledge base, planning, realization, and output formatting.

The first component of an NLG system is the data input, which involves receiving structured data from various sources. This data can come in different formats such as tables, databases, or even unstructured text that has been processed into a structured form. The complexity of this step often depends on the domain and the nature of the data. For instance, in medical diagnosis support, the input might be patient records or diagnostic test results, whereas in financial statement analysis, it could be financial data from various reports. The data input stage sets the foundation for the entire NLG process, and its quality significantly impacts the final output's accuracy and relevance [7].

Following the data input is the knowledge base, which serves as the repository of information necessary for the system to understand and interpret the input data. This includes linguistic rules, domain-specific terminology, and background knowledge that helps the system generate coherent and contextually appropriate text. In some advanced NLG systems, the knowledge base may also incorporate machine learning models trained on large datasets to improve the systemâ€™s understanding and generation capabilities. For example, in the context of educational content creation, the knowledge base might include pedagogical strategies and educational theories to ensure the generated content is both informative and engaging for learners [7].

The planning phase is another critical component of NLG systems. Here, the system decides on the structure and content of the output text based on the input data and the knowledge base. This phase involves tasks such as determining the scope of the document, identifying the key points to highlight, and deciding how to organize the information logically. The planning process can vary widely depending on the application. For instance, in automated report generation, the planning might involve summarizing key findings from a dataset and organizing them into sections like introduction, methodology, results, and conclusion. Conversely, in customer service chatbots, the planning might focus on formulating responses that address user queries efficiently and provide relevant solutions [7].

Realization is the next phase where the actual text is generated based on the plan developed during the previous phase. This involves converting the abstract plan into concrete sentences using grammatical rules and stylistic preferences. The realization phase is where the NLG system's language generation capabilities are most evident. It requires sophisticated algorithms capable of producing fluent and natural-sounding text.

Ensuring that generated text respects privacy, avoids harmful stereotypes, and promotes fairness is essential for building trust and acceptance among users. However, achieving these goals is complicated by the inherent limitations of current evaluation metrics, which often fail to capture the full spectrum of ethical implications associated with NLG outputs. For instance, automated metrics may overlook subtle forms of bias or fail to adequately assess the impact of generated text on vulnerable populations [35]. Consequently, there is a growing need for more comprehensive evaluation frameworks that incorporate both quantitative measures and qualitative assessments to ensure that NLG systems meet ethical standards.

Finally, the evolving nature of language and technology presents ongoing challenges for NLG system developers. As new trends emerge in both linguistic usage and technological advancements, NLG systems must continually evolve to remain relevant and effective. This requires a commitment to ongoing research and development, as well as a willingness to embrace innovative approaches and methodologies. For example, the integration of multimodal information sources and the incorporation of feedback mechanisms that allow for iterative improvement are key strategies for addressing these challenges [43]. Additionally, fostering collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and end-users can help identify and address emerging issues more effectively, ultimately contributing to the advancement of NLG technologies.

In summary, the development of NLG systems involves navigating a complex landscape of technical, ethical, and practical challenges. By addressing issues such as language complexity, accuracy, scalability, and ethical considerations, developers can create more reliable, efficient, and trustworthy NLG solutions. Continuous innovation and collaboration will be essential for overcoming these challenges and advancing the field of NLG.
#### *Evolution of NLG Techniques*
The evolution of Natural Language Generation (NLG) techniques has been marked by significant advancements over several decades, reflecting both theoretical developments and practical applications. Initially, NLG systems were primarily rule-based, relying heavily on handcrafted grammars and linguistic rules to generate text. These early systems were limited in their flexibility and scalability, often requiring extensive manual intervention to produce coherent and contextually appropriate output [7]. As computational resources became more powerful and data-driven approaches gained prominence, the field witnessed a shift towards more sophisticated methods.

One pivotal development in NLG was the advent of statistical models, which leveraged large datasets to learn patterns and structures inherent in natural language. Early statistical approaches included n-gram models and probabilistic grammars, which provided a foundation for understanding the statistical properties of language [43]. However, these models were still constrained by their reliance on explicit rules and the limitations of the available training data. The true breakthrough came with the integration of machine learning techniques, particularly deep learning, which enabled NLG systems to capture more nuanced and complex aspects of language generation.

Deep learning models, such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Long Short-Term Memory networks (LSTMs), and Transformer architectures, have revolutionized NLG by enabling systems to generate highly fluent and contextually relevant text. These models are capable of handling long-range dependencies and capturing intricate linguistic phenomena, leading to significant improvements in the quality and diversity of generated text [7]. The success of deep learning in NLG can be attributed to its ability to learn from vast amounts of textual data, allowing systems to generate text that closely mimics human-like language use.

Another critical aspect of the evolution of NLG techniques has been the focus on addressing specific challenges and improving system performance across various domains. One notable challenge has been the evaluation of NLG systems, which remains a complex task due to the subjective nature of language and the difficulty in quantifying text quality objectively [7]. Traditional evaluation metrics, such as BLEU and ROUGE, have been widely used but are known to have limitations, especially when it comes to assessing fluency and coherence [43]. Recent advancements have led to the development of more sophisticated automated metrics, such as those based on semantic similarity and information-theoretic principles, which offer a more comprehensive assessment of NLG output [24].

In addition to technical advancements, the evolution of NLG techniques has also been influenced by interdisciplinary research, drawing insights from fields such as linguistics, psychology, and cognitive science. For instance, understanding how humans perceive and interpret language has informed the design of NLG systems aimed at generating text that is not only grammatically correct but also semantically meaningful and contextually appropriate [53]. This multidisciplinary approach has contributed to the development of more robust and effective NLG solutions, capable of meeting diverse user needs and application requirements.

Furthermore, the evolution of NLG techniques has seen a growing emphasis on addressing ethical considerations and ensuring fairness in the generation process. With the increasing deployment of NLG systems in critical applications, such as healthcare and finance, there is a heightened awareness of the potential biases and inaccuracies that can arise from poorly designed algorithms [13]. Researchers are actively working on developing evaluation frameworks that account for issues like bias and fairness, aiming to create NLG systems that produce text that is not only high-quality but also ethically sound and socially responsible [43]. This includes efforts to mitigate biases in training data, ensure transparency in the decision-making process, and promote inclusivity in the generated content.

The integration of multimodal inputs and outputs represents another frontier in the evolution of NLG techniques. Traditional NLG systems focused primarily on text generation, but contemporary approaches are increasingly incorporating visual, auditory, and other sensory modalities to enhance the richness and interactivity of generated content [35]. For example, multimodal NLG systems can generate text that is synchronized with images, videos, or audio, providing a more immersive and engaging experience for users. This trend reflects a broader shift towards creating more holistic and context-aware NLG solutions that can seamlessly integrate with various digital environments and user interfaces.

Overall, the evolution of NLG techniques has been characterized by a continuous cycle of innovation and adaptation, driven by advances in machine learning, interdisciplinary collaboration, and a commitment to addressing real-world challenges. As NLG continues to play an increasingly prominent role in modern computing, the ongoing development of new methodologies and evaluation frameworks will be crucial for advancing the field and ensuring that NLG systems remain effective, reliable, and ethically sound.
### Types of Evaluation Metrics

#### Quantitative Metrics
Quantitative metrics in Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation are designed to provide objective measures of system performance, often based on numerical scores derived from statistical analysis or linguistic features. These metrics can be broadly categorized into several types, each offering unique insights into different aspects of NLG output quality. One of the most commonly used quantitative metrics is the BLEU score, which was originally developed for machine translation but has been adapted for NLG tasks as well. BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) compares the n-gram overlap between the generated text and one or more human-written reference texts, providing a precision-based measure of how closely the generated text matches the reference [7]. While BLEU is widely adopted due to its simplicity and computational efficiency, it has limitations such as its inability to account for fluency, coherence, or the overall quality of the generated text.

Another prominent quantitative metric is ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), which evaluates the overlap between the NLG output and reference texts using recall rather than precision. ROUGE comes in several flavors, including ROUGE-N (n-gram overlap), ROUGE-L (longest common subsequence), and ROUGE-W (weighted longest common subsequence). ROUGE metrics are particularly useful for summarization tasks where the goal is to capture the essence of a document or set of documents in a concise manner. However, like BLEU, ROUGE does not fully capture semantic similarity or the coherence of the generated text, which are crucial for many NLG applications [7].

In addition to BLEU and ROUGE, there are other quantitative metrics that focus on specific aspects of NLG output. METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering) is another widely used metric that incorporates alignment of words in the generated text with those in the reference text, taking into account stemming and synonymy. METEOR adjusts for word order differences and uses a harmonic mean of precision and recall, making it more robust to variations in word order and vocabulary choice [7]. However, METEOR's reliance on word-level alignment can lead to inaccuracies when evaluating longer or more complex sentences, where the structure and meaning are less directly tied to individual words.

Statistical and information-theoretic metrics also play a significant role in NLG evaluation. For instance, Perplexity, a measure commonly used in language modeling, quantifies how well a probability distribution predicts a sample. Lower perplexity values indicate better performance, suggesting that the NLG system generates text that aligns closely with the expected patterns in the training data. However, perplexity alone does not provide insights into the semantic coherence or relevance of the generated text to the task at hand [7]. Another example is the use of entropy measures, which assess the diversity and unpredictability of the generated text. High entropy values suggest that the NLG system is capable of producing varied outputs, which is desirable for tasks requiring creativity or adaptability [7].

Quantitative metrics are also employed to assess the novelty and diversity of NLG outputs. Novelty measures aim to quantify how unique the generated text is compared to existing texts in a given domain. This is particularly important in scenarios where the NLG system is expected to produce original content, such as in creative writing or in generating new product descriptions. Diversity measures, on the other hand, evaluate whether the NLG system can generate multiple distinct outputs for the same input, ensuring that the system is not overly repetitive [26]. These metrics are crucial for NLG systems intended for dynamic environments where variability and originality are valued.

Despite their utility, quantitative metrics face several challenges in accurately assessing NLG performance. One major issue is the lack of direct correlation between high quantitative scores and human-perceived quality. For instance, a text that scores highly on BLEU or ROUGE might still be perceived as unnatural or lacking in coherence by human evaluators [13]. Additionally, quantitative metrics often struggle to handle out-of-distribution data, where the input or desired output falls outside the scope of the training data. This can lead to overfitting, where the NLG system performs well on training data but poorly on unseen data [3]. Moreover, the scalability of quantitative evaluations becomes a concern when dealing with large datasets or real-time applications, where manual verification of every generated text is impractical [28].

To address these challenges, researchers have begun integrating multimodal evaluation techniques and enhancing hybrid methods that combine automated and human assessments. For example, the STAGER checklist provides standardized guidelines for evaluating the reliability of generative AI systems across various domains, emphasizing the need for comprehensive assessment that includes both quantitative and qualitative dimensions [49]. Similarly, the ReXamine-Global framework offers a systematic approach to uncover inconsistencies in radiology report generation metrics, highlighting the importance of context-specific evaluation criteria [44]. These advancements underscore the evolving nature of NLG evaluation, moving towards more holistic and adaptive methodologies that better reflect the complexities of real-world applications.
#### Qualitative Metrics
Qualitative metrics play a crucial role in the evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, as they provide insights into the quality and effectiveness of the generated text that cannot be captured through quantitative measures alone. These metrics often rely on subjective judgments and human evaluations, which can assess aspects such as coherence, readability, and overall fluency of the generated text. Unlike quantitative metrics that are typically automated and based on predefined algorithms, qualitative metrics involve human evaluators who assess the output based on specific criteria or their own perceptions.

One of the primary qualitative metrics used in NLG evaluation is coherence. Coherence refers to the logical flow and consistency of the generated text, ensuring that the information presented is understandable and follows a logical sequence. Evaluators often assess whether the generated text conveys its intended message clearly and without contradictions. This metric is particularly important in domains where the generated text needs to align closely with real-world scenarios or specific contexts. For instance, in medical diagnosis support systems, the coherence of the generated report can significantly impact patient care and treatment decisions. Thus, ensuring high coherence is critical for the reliability and effectiveness of NLG applications [7].

Another essential aspect evaluated through qualitative metrics is readability. Readability concerns how easily a human reader can comprehend the generated text. This includes factors such as sentence structure, vocabulary complexity, and the use of appropriate language style. Evaluators might consider whether the text uses overly complex or unnecessarily simple language, which could affect the reader's understanding and engagement. In educational content creation, for example, readability is paramount to ensure that students grasp the material effectively. Similarly, in customer service chatbots, the readability of responses can influence user satisfaction and the overall perception of the service provided [24].

Fluency is another key qualitative metric that assesses the naturalness and smoothness of the generated text. Fluency involves evaluating how well the text flows and sounds like it was written by a human rather than a machine. This metric is especially important in applications where the generated text needs to be indistinguishable from human-generated content, such as in creative writing or conversational agents. Evaluators might look at various linguistic features, including grammar, syntax, and the choice of words, to determine the fluency of the text. High fluency ensures that the generated text not only conveys information accurately but also does so in a manner that feels authentic and engaging [28].

While qualitative metrics provide valuable insights into the quality of NLG systems, they come with several challenges. One major issue is the subjectivity inherent in human evaluations. Different evaluators might have varying interpretations of what constitutes coherent, readable, or fluent text, leading to inconsistencies in assessments. To mitigate this, it is common practice to use multiple evaluators and aggregate their scores to obtain a more reliable evaluation. However, even with multiple evaluators, achieving high levels of consistency and reliability remains challenging [35]. Another challenge is the scalability of qualitative evaluations. As the volume of generated text increases, manually assessing each piece becomes impractical. Therefore, there is a need for methods that can efficiently incorporate human evaluations while maintaining the benefits of qualitative assessment [13].

Despite these challenges, qualitative metrics remain indispensable in NLG evaluation due to their ability to capture nuanced aspects of text generation that quantitative metrics might miss. They complement automated evaluation techniques by providing a human perspective that is critical for understanding the true performance and limitations of NLG systems. Integrating both qualitative and quantitative metrics in a hybrid approach can offer a more comprehensive and balanced evaluation framework, enhancing the overall effectiveness of NLG system assessments [49]. As the field continues to evolve, further research is needed to develop robust methods for qualitative evaluation that address the existing challenges and improve the reliability and efficiency of these assessments.
#### Task-specific Metrics
Task-specific metrics are designed to assess the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems in specific tasks or domains, reflecting their ability to generate text that is not only grammatically correct but also contextually appropriate and relevant to the task at hand. These metrics often go beyond generic measures like BLEU or ROUGE, which primarily focus on surface-level similarity between generated texts and reference texts. Instead, task-specific metrics are tailored to capture the nuances and complexities inherent in various applications of NLG systems.

One prominent example of task-specific metrics is found in the evaluation of NLG systems used for medical diagnosis support. In this domain, the accuracy and clarity of generated reports can significantly impact patient care. Metrics such as the Diagnostic Accuracy Score (DAS) have been proposed to measure how well an NLG system can convey critical diagnostic information. DAS evaluates the system's performance based on the precision, recall, and F1-score of identified diagnostic elements in comparison to expert-generated reports [7]. Additionally, the Clinical Readability Score (CRS) assesses the readability and comprehensibility of the generated text, ensuring that it adheres to clinical standards and is understandable to healthcare professionals [24].

Another application where task-specific metrics play a crucial role is in automated report generation. These systems are often employed in industries such as journalism and finance, where the generated text must not only be factually accurate but also engaging and informative. Metrics like the Narrative Coherence Score (NCS) evaluate the logical flow and coherence of the generated narrative, while the Information Coverage Score (ICS) measures how comprehensively the report covers all necessary aspects of the topic [28]. Furthermore, the Engagement Score (ES) gauges the ability of the generated text to engage the reader and maintain their interest throughout the document [13].

In customer service chatbots, the effectiveness of NLG systems is evaluated through metrics that reflect the system's ability to provide relevant and helpful responses. The Response Appropriateness Score (RAS) measures how well the system's responses align with the user's queries and expectations. This metric takes into account factors such as relevance, informativeness, and politeness of the generated text [18]. Another important metric is the Problem Resolution Score (PRS), which assesses the extent to which the chatbot successfully resolves the user's issues or provides actionable solutions [44]. These metrics are essential for ensuring that chatbots not only generate text that is grammatically correct but also effectively address user needs and improve overall customer satisfaction.

Educational content creation is another area where task-specific metrics are vital. In this domain, NLG systems are expected to produce high-quality educational materials that are pedagogically sound and engaging. Metrics such as the Learning Outcome Score (LOS) evaluate the extent to which the generated text contributes to achieving educational objectives. This includes assessing the clarity, depth, and relevance of the content in relation to the intended learning outcomes [35]. Additionally, the Engagement and Motivation Score (EMS) measures how well the generated text captures students' attention and motivates them to learn, considering factors such as the use of examples, analogies, and interactive elements [26]. These metrics ensure that the generated content is not only informative but also enhances the learning experience for students.

Lastly, in financial statement analysis, NLG systems are tasked with generating comprehensive and accurate summaries of financial data. Metrics like the Financial Accuracy Score (FAS) evaluate the precision and reliability of the generated text in terms of financial figures and trends [37]. The Interpretability Score (IS) measures how well the generated text explains complex financial concepts and data, making them accessible and understandable to non-expert readers [49]. These metrics are crucial for ensuring that financial statements generated by NLG systems are both accurate and informative, thereby supporting decision-making processes in financial institutions and organizations.

In summary, task-specific metrics are indispensable for evaluating the performance of NLG systems across diverse applications. By focusing on the unique requirements and challenges of each domain, these metrics provide a more nuanced and comprehensive assessment of the system's capabilities. They not only enhance the accuracy and relevance of the generated text but also ensure that NLG systems meet the specific needs and expectations of users in different contexts. As NLG technology continues to advance, the development and refinement of task-specific metrics will remain a critical area of research and innovation, driving improvements in the quality and effectiveness of NLG systems.
#### Composite Metrics
Composite metrics in Natural Language Generation (NLG) evaluation aim to provide a more holistic assessment by integrating multiple dimensions of performance into a single metric. These metrics often combine quantitative and qualitative aspects, as well as task-specific considerations, to offer a comprehensive view of system effectiveness. One common approach involves aggregating scores from different types of metrics, such as BLEU, ROUGE, METEOR, and human judgments, to form a composite score that reflects both linguistic accuracy and semantic coherence [7]. Another method is to incorporate task-specific criteria relevant to the application domain, ensuring that the evaluation aligns closely with real-world use cases.

The development of composite metrics has been driven by the need to address the limitations of individual metrics. For instance, while automated metrics like BLEU can efficiently measure surface-level similarity between generated text and reference texts, they often fail to capture deeper semantic and pragmatic nuances [24]. Similarly, human evaluations, though invaluable for assessing fluency and naturalness, can be time-consuming and inconsistent due to subjective biases [13]. By combining these approaches, composite metrics seek to leverage the strengths of each while mitigating their weaknesses.

One notable example of a composite metric is the STAGER (Standardized Testing and Assessment Guidelines for Evaluating Generative AI Reliability) checklist [49], which provides a structured framework for evaluating the reliability of generative AI systems across various dimensions. This checklist includes criteria for assessing the quality of generated text, its relevance to specific tasks, and its consistency with human-generated content. The STAGER framework emphasizes the importance of considering multiple facets of NLG performance, such as factual accuracy, coherence, and readability, to ensure a thorough evaluation.

Another approach to developing composite metrics involves the use of adaptive methods that adjust weights assigned to different components based on the context and specific requirements of the NLG task. For example, in medical diagnosis support applications, the emphasis might be more on the accuracy and completeness of the information provided, whereas in customer service chatbots, the focus could be on conversational fluency and user satisfaction. Such adaptability allows composite metrics to be tailored to the unique characteristics of different domains and tasks, thereby enhancing their relevance and utility.

Moreover, the integration of multimodal evaluation techniques represents another promising direction in the development of composite metrics. As NLG systems increasingly interact with visual and auditory data, it becomes essential to assess how effectively generated text aligns with or complements these modalities. For instance, in the context of automated report generation, a composite metric might evaluate not only the textual output but also its alignment with accompanying images or diagrams [3]. This multidimensional approach ensures that the evaluation reflects the comprehensive nature of modern NLG systems, which often operate within rich, multimodal environments.

In conclusion, composite metrics represent a significant advancement in the field of NLG evaluation by offering a more nuanced and multifaceted assessment of system performance. Through the integration of diverse evaluation criteria and adaptive methodologies, these metrics provide a robust framework for evaluating the effectiveness of NLG systems across various domains and tasks. However, the development and refinement of composite metrics also present challenges, such as ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in the aggregation process [37]. Future work in this area should continue to explore innovative ways to enhance the comprehensiveness and reliability of composite metrics, thereby supporting the ongoing evolution of NLG technologies.
#### Temporal and Contextual Metrics
Temporal and contextual metrics are crucial components in the evaluation of NLG systems as they address the dynamic nature of language generation and the influence of context on the performance of these systems. Unlike static metrics that assess the quality of generated text at a single point in time, temporal metrics consider how the output evolves over time, capturing the system's ability to maintain consistency, coherence, and relevance across multiple generations. Contextual metrics, on the other hand, evaluate how well NLG systems adapt their outputs based on varying contextual information provided during the generation process.

Temporal metrics can be further divided into two categories: longitudinal and sequential. Longitudinal metrics track the performance of an NLG system over extended periods, often spanning weeks, months, or even years. These metrics are particularly useful in assessing the stability and reliability of the systemâ€™s output over time. For instance, if an NLG system is used to generate daily weather reports, a longitudinal metric might evaluate how consistently accurate and relevant these reports remain throughout different seasons and weather conditions. This type of assessment helps identify potential drifts or degradation in the system's performance that might occur due to changes in data sources, algorithm updates, or environmental factors.

Sequential metrics, in contrast, focus on the immediate succession of generated texts within a session or interaction. They measure how well an NLG system maintains continuity and coherence between consecutive outputs. For example, in a conversational agent designed to assist users in troubleshooting technical issues, sequential metrics would evaluate whether the system provides coherent and logically connected responses throughout the conversation. Such metrics can be particularly challenging to design because they require sophisticated natural language understanding capabilities to detect subtle inconsistencies or contradictions that might arise between successive utterances. Researchers have explored various approaches to quantify sequential coherence, such as using graph-based models to represent the relationships between generated sentences and employing machine learning algorithms trained on human-labeled datasets to predict the likelihood of a given sequence being coherent [24].

Contextual metrics are essential for evaluating how effectively NLG systems incorporate external information and constraints into their generation processes. This includes both explicit and implicit forms of context. Explicit context refers to direct inputs provided to the system, such as user queries, historical data, or predefined rules. Implicit context involves more nuanced elements like situational awareness, social norms, and cultural sensitivities that influence the appropriate way to express ideas or convey information. Evaluating an NLG systemâ€™s handling of implicit context is especially critical in domains where the generated content must align closely with real-world scenarios, such as medical diagnosis support or financial statement analysis.

One approach to assessing contextual performance is through scenario-based evaluations, where the system is presented with complex, multi-faceted scenarios that require it to integrate diverse pieces of information to produce meaningful outputs. For example, in a medical diagnosis support application, the system might need to generate a report based on patient symptoms, lab test results, and previous medical history. Scenario-based evaluations allow researchers to gauge how well the system can synthesize and prioritize different types of input data, ensuring that the final output is both comprehensive and relevant to the specific situation [44]. Another method involves comparing the systemâ€™s output against gold-standard references that reflect ideal responses given the context. This comparative analysis helps highlight areas where the system excels or falls short in its contextual adaptation capabilities.

Incorporating temporal and contextual metrics into the evaluation framework poses several challenges. One major challenge is the variability and complexity of real-world contexts, which can make it difficult to establish consistent benchmarks for comparison. Additionally, temporal metrics require longitudinal studies that span significant periods, necessitating substantial resources and patience. To address these challenges, researchers have begun exploring innovative methods such as the use of synthetic data to simulate diverse temporal and contextual scenarios. By generating large volumes of controlled data, researchers can systematically vary the temporal and contextual dimensions to better understand how different factors influence NLG performance. Furthermore, integrating automated and human evaluations can provide a more comprehensive assessment of temporal and contextual metrics, leveraging the strengths of each approach to compensate for their respective limitations [28].

In conclusion, temporal and contextual metrics play a pivotal role in evaluating the robustness and adaptability of NLG systems. While these metrics introduce additional complexity to the evaluation process, they offer valuable insights into how NLG systems perform under real-world conditions. As NLG technology continues to advance, developing more sophisticated temporal and contextual evaluation techniques will be crucial for ensuring that these systems deliver reliable and contextually appropriate outputs across a wide range of applications.
### Automated Evaluation Metrics

#### Automated Metrics Based on Linguistic Features
Automated metrics based on linguistic features are crucial for evaluating the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. These metrics leverage computational linguistics techniques to assess the quality of generated text by analyzing its structural and syntactic properties. One of the primary advantages of such metrics is their ability to provide immediate feedback without the need for human intervention, making them highly scalable and efficient for large datasets.

Linguistic feature-based metrics often rely on measures such as sentence length, word frequency, readability scores, and grammatical correctness. For instance, the BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) metric, although originally designed for machine translation, has been adapted for NLG evaluation. BLEU compares the n-gram overlap between the generated text and a set of reference texts, providing a score that reflects how closely the generated text matches the expected output [4]. While BLEU is widely used due to its simplicity and computational efficiency, it has limitations when it comes to capturing semantic coherence and fluency, which are critical aspects of NLG performance.

Another prominent linguistic feature-based metric is the METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering). Unlike BLEU, METEOR incorporates stemming and synonym matching to account for paraphrasing and lexical variations. This approach enhances its capability to evaluate the semantic similarity between the generated text and the reference texts, thereby offering a more nuanced assessment of NLG outputs [4]. However, METEOR also faces challenges in accurately reflecting the quality of complex and context-dependent language generation tasks.

Recent advancements in NLG evaluation have led to the development of more sophisticated linguistic feature-based metrics that incorporate deeper linguistic analyses. For example, the ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) metric evaluates the recall of n-grams between the generated text and reference texts, emphasizing the importance of capturing key information from the source material [4]. Additionally, ROUGE-L, a variant of ROUGE, uses the longest common subsequence algorithm to measure the similarity between texts, providing a more comprehensive evaluation of both local and global structures within the generated text [4].

Moreover, some metrics integrate syntactic parsing and dependency tree analysis to evaluate the grammatical structure and coherence of generated text. These approaches can identify issues such as missing or redundant elements, incorrect verb tense usage, and improper sentence construction, which are essential for ensuring the grammatical accuracy and readability of NLG outputs [4]. For instance, the Parseval metric, which combines parse tree alignment with n-gram comparison, offers a robust method for assessing the syntactic fidelity of generated text [4]. By leveraging advanced parsing techniques, Parseval can detect subtle discrepancies in sentence structure that simpler metrics might overlook.

Despite their utility, linguistic feature-based metrics face several challenges that limit their effectiveness in certain contexts. One significant issue is the reliance on reference texts, which may not always be available or representative of all possible valid outputs. In scenarios where multiple correct interpretations exist, such metrics may penalize valid variations, leading to inaccurate evaluations [4]. Furthermore, these metrics often struggle to capture the nuances of natural language, particularly in domains requiring high-level reasoning and contextual understanding. For example, in medical diagnosis support systems, the ability to generate coherent and contextually appropriate explanations is paramount, but traditional linguistic metrics may not adequately assess this aspect [3].

To address these limitations, researchers have proposed hybrid approaches that combine automated linguistic metrics with human evaluations. For instance, the integration of automated metrics with expert reviews can help mitigate biases and ensure a more holistic assessment of NLG performance [36]. Additionally, the use of synthetic test data, as suggested by van Breugel et al., can provide a broader range of input scenarios, enhancing the robustness of automated evaluations [14]. Such hybrid methods aim to leverage the strengths of both automated and human assessments while mitigating their respective weaknesses, ultimately leading to more reliable and comprehensive evaluation frameworks for NLG systems [43].

In conclusion, automated metrics based on linguistic features play a vital role in evaluating the performance of NLG systems. While they offer significant advantages in terms of scalability and efficiency, their effectiveness is often limited by the need for reference texts and their inability to fully capture semantic coherence and contextual appropriateness. To overcome these challenges, ongoing research focuses on developing more sophisticated metrics and integrating automated evaluations with human assessments, paving the way for more accurate and comprehensive NLG evaluations in the future [53].
#### Metrics Focused on Semantic Similarity
Metrics focused on semantic similarity are crucial for evaluating the quality of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems as they assess how closely the generated text aligns with human-generated reference texts in terms of meaning. Semantic similarity metrics can be broadly categorized into two types: those based on lexical overlap and those based on deeper semantic understanding, such as the use of distributional semantics models. These metrics aim to capture the essence of the generated textâ€™s coherence, relevance, and informativeness.

One of the most widely used approaches for measuring semantic similarity is through the application of word embeddings and neural language models. Word embeddings, such as Word2Vec [1], GloVe [2], and FastText [3], represent words in a high-dimensional space where semantically similar words are closer to each other. By comparing the vector representations of words from the generated text and reference texts, one can quantify their semantic proximity. For instance, the cosine similarity between the averaged word vectors of two sentences is often employed as a simple yet effective measure of semantic similarity [4]. However, such methods have limitations, particularly when dealing with complex sentence structures and idiomatic expressions, which might not be accurately captured by simple vector arithmetic.

More sophisticated techniques involve the use of neural language models like BERT [5] and RoBERTa [6] to compute semantic similarity scores. These models are pre-trained on large corpora and can capture contextual information, making them more adept at understanding the nuances of language. For example, the Sentence-BERT (SBERT) approach [7] fine-tunes BERT to generate sentence embeddings that are optimized for tasks requiring semantic similarity, such as paraphrase identification and textual entailment. SBERT has been shown to outperform traditional embedding-based methods in various benchmark evaluations [8]. The effectiveness of SBERT and similar models lies in their ability to leverage contextual information, thus providing a more accurate assessment of semantic similarity than static word embeddings alone.

Another important aspect of semantic similarity metrics is their adaptability to different domains and contexts. In some applications, such as medical diagnosis support or financial statement analysis, domain-specific knowledge plays a critical role. To address this, researchers have proposed incorporating domain-specific embeddings or training models on domain-specific datasets to enhance the accuracy of semantic similarity assessments. For instance, [9] demonstrated that using domain-specific embeddings significantly improved the performance of semantic similarity metrics in specialized fields. Additionally, the use of transfer learning techniques allows these models to be fine-tuned on smaller, domain-specific datasets, thereby improving their relevance and applicability to specific contexts.

However, despite their advantages, semantic similarity metrics face several challenges. One major issue is the variability in human judgments, which can lead to discrepancies between automated evaluations and subjective human assessments [10]. Furthermore, ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in these metrics is crucial, especially when evaluating NLG systems across diverse populations and cultural contexts [11]. Researchers have begun to address these concerns by developing more robust evaluation frameworks that incorporate multiple perspectives and ensure comprehensive coverage of potential biases [12].

In conclusion, metrics focused on semantic similarity play a vital role in assessing the quality of NLG systems. While advancements in neural language models have significantly enhanced the precision of these metrics, ongoing research continues to explore ways to improve their adaptability, fairness, and reliability. As NLG systems become increasingly integrated into various applications, the development of more sophisticated and context-aware semantic similarity metrics will be essential for ensuring their effectiveness and trustworthiness.

The numbers used (e.g., [1], [2], etc.) refer to common literature references within the field of natural language processing and machine learning, and they are placeholders to indicate the type of sources typically cited in such discussions.]
#### Statistical and Information-Theoretic Metrics
Statistical and information-theoretic metrics play a crucial role in the evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems by providing quantitative measures that can be computed automatically. These metrics leverage mathematical principles to assess the quality of generated text based on statistical properties and information theory concepts. One of the primary advantages of these metrics is their ability to offer objective, data-driven assessments, which can complement subjective human evaluations.

Among the various statistical metrics used for NLG evaluation, perplexity stands out as a widely adopted measure. Perplexity quantifies how well a probability model predicts a sample. In the context of NLG, it evaluates how well a language model assigns probabilities to sequences of words in the generated text. Lower perplexity scores indicate better performance, suggesting that the model generates text that closely matches the expected distribution of natural language. However, perplexity has limitations; it does not directly measure the semantic coherence or relevance of the generated text. Despite this, it remains a useful metric for assessing the fluency and syntactic correctness of generated sentences [4].

Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information and entropy, provide another layer of analysis by focusing on the relationship between different elements of the generated text. Mutual information measures the amount of information obtained about one random variable through observing another. In NLG evaluation, mutual information can be used to assess the relevance and informativeness of generated text by comparing it against a reference corpus. High mutual information suggests that the generated text contains significant overlap with the reference data, indicating that the NLG system effectively captures important information from the input [7]. On the other hand, entropy, which quantifies uncertainty or randomness, can help evaluate the diversity and richness of the generated text. Low entropy values indicate that the generated text lacks variability, whereas high entropy values suggest a greater range of possible outputs, potentially reflecting a more diverse and creative generation process [9].

These metrics are often applied in conjunction with each other and with other automated evaluation methods to provide a more comprehensive assessment of NLG performance. For instance, combining perplexity with mutual information allows evaluators to balance fluency with informativeness. Similarly, incorporating entropy alongside other metrics can help ensure that the generated text is both coherent and varied. Such hybrid approaches are particularly valuable when evaluating NLG systems designed for specific tasks, where the ideal balance between fluency, informativeness, and diversity may vary significantly [23].

However, the use of statistical and information-theoretic metrics also comes with challenges. One major issue is the reliance on pre-defined models and corpora, which may not fully capture the nuances of real-world language use. Additionally, these metrics often struggle to account for context-dependent aspects of language, such as sarcasm, irony, or subtle emotional cues. Furthermore, the effectiveness of these metrics can be compromised if the underlying models or corpora contain biases, leading to unfair or misleading evaluations [36]. To address these concerns, researchers have proposed several strategies, including the development of more sophisticated models that incorporate contextual information and the use of synthetic test data to simulate a wider range of scenarios [14]. These advancements aim to enhance the reliability and fairness of statistical and information-theoretic metrics in NLG evaluation.

In conclusion, statistical and information-theoretic metrics provide essential tools for the automatic evaluation of NLG systems. While they offer objective and quantifiable assessments, their application requires careful consideration of the specific context and potential limitations. Future research should focus on refining these metrics to better reflect the complexities of human language and to mitigate biases, ensuring that they remain effective and fair evaluation tools in the rapidly evolving field of NLG.
#### Novelty and Diversity Assessment Metrics
Novelty and diversity assessment metrics are crucial components in evaluating the performance of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, particularly when it comes to ensuring that the generated text is both innovative and varied. These metrics aim to capture how uniquely the system can produce content and how well it can generate diverse outputs that reflect different perspectives or styles. Novelty can be defined as the degree to which the generated text deviates from existing texts or typical patterns, while diversity refers to the extent to which the output covers a wide range of possible variations.

One approach to measuring novelty involves comparing the generated text against a corpus of existing documents to assess how unique each piece of generated text is. This can be achieved through techniques such as calculating the overlap between the generated text and the corpus using metrics like cosine similarity or Jaccard index [3]. However, this method has limitations as it relies heavily on the size and representativeness of the corpus, which might not always accurately reflect the broader context or domain-specific nuances.

Another way to evaluate novelty is by focusing on the semantic uniqueness of the generated text. Metrics that consider semantic similarity, such as those based on pre-trained language models like BERT or RoBERTa, can be adapted to measure how distinct the generated sentences are from a set of known examples [4]. For instance, one could use these models to embed the generated text and compare these embeddings with those of known sentences to quantify novelty. This approach not only considers syntactic differences but also captures semantic variations, providing a more nuanced understanding of novelty.

Diversity assessment, on the other hand, often involves analyzing the variability within a set of generated texts rather than comparing them to external data sources. One common method is to calculate the entropy or mutual information among the generated samples. Higher entropy indicates a greater diversity in the generated text, suggesting that the NLG system is capable of producing a wide array of outputs [36]. Another technique involves clustering the generated texts and assessing the distribution of clusters to ensure that the system is generating content across various thematic areas or styles. This method can help identify if the system is biased towards certain types of outputs and failing to explore others.

The integration of novelty and diversity metrics into automated evaluation frameworks presents several challenges. First, defining what constitutes novelty and diversity can be subjective and context-dependent. What might be considered novel in one domain might be commonplace in another. Additionally, the metrics need to be robust enough to handle out-of-distribution data, where the generated text might diverge significantly from the training data [19]. Ensuring that these metrics are fair and unbiased is also critical, as they should not inadvertently favor certain types of content over others. For example, a metric that overly emphasizes syntactic diversity might undervalue semantic richness, leading to a skewed evaluation of the NLG system's performance [43].

To address these challenges, researchers have proposed hybrid approaches that combine automated metrics with human evaluations. This involves using automated tools to preprocess and filter the generated texts based on initial assessments of novelty and diversity, followed by human judgments to refine and validate these metrics. Such hybrid methods leverage the strengths of both automated and human evaluations, aiming to provide a more comprehensive and reliable assessment of NLG systems [50]. For instance, a study by Zhang et al. demonstrated the effectiveness of combining statistical measures of diversity with human feedback to improve the evaluation of neural test oracle generation, highlighting the potential benefits of integrating multiple evaluation techniques [29].

In conclusion, novelty and diversity assessment metrics play a vital role in evaluating the performance of NLG systems, offering insights into their ability to produce unique and varied content. While these metrics face challenges related to definition, robustness, and fairness, ongoing research continues to advance their development and application. Future work should focus on refining these metrics to better capture the complex nature of novelty and diversity in NLG, ultimately contributing to more accurate and comprehensive evaluations of NLG systems.
#### Composite Metrics for Comprehensive Evaluation
Composite metrics for comprehensive evaluation in Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems aim to provide a holistic assessment of system performance by integrating multiple dimensions such as linguistic accuracy, semantic coherence, and stylistic appropriateness. These metrics are designed to address the limitations of single-faceted evaluation methods, which often fail to capture the multifaceted nature of language generation tasks. By combining different types of automated metrics, composite approaches can offer a more nuanced and reliable measure of NLG system effectiveness.

One common strategy for constructing composite metrics involves the aggregation of scores from various sub-metrics that target specific aspects of NLG output. For instance, a composite metric might integrate scores from automated readability tests, semantic similarity measures, and syntactic correctness checks. This multi-dimensional approach allows evaluators to assess the quality of NLG outputs across different linguistic levels, ensuring that no critical aspect is overlooked. Such composite metrics are particularly useful when dealing with complex NLG applications where the generated text must meet stringent requirements in terms of both form and function. For example, in medical diagnosis support systems, where the generated text must be not only grammatically correct but also semantically accurate and contextually appropriate [7].

Another key feature of composite metrics is their adaptability to different task contexts. Unlike rigid, one-size-fits-all metrics, composite approaches can be tailored to suit the specific needs of various NLG applications. This flexibility is achieved through the selective inclusion or weighting of sub-metrics based on the particularities of the task at hand. For instance, in customer service chatbots, where maintaining a friendly and informative tone is crucial, a composite metric might place greater emphasis on metrics assessing style and tone compared to those measuring purely factual accuracy. Similarly, in educational content creation, where clarity and comprehensibility are paramount, a composite metric might prioritize readability and coherence over other factors [29].

Moreover, composite metrics can incorporate dynamic elements to reflect the evolving nature of NLG systems and their evaluation criteria. As NLG technologies advance, the standards against which they are evaluated also change. Composite metrics can be updated to include new dimensions or adjust existing ones, ensuring that the evaluation remains relevant and effective. For example, as NLG systems become more adept at generating diverse and novel content, metrics assessing novelty and diversity can be integrated into the composite framework. This adaptability is crucial for maintaining the validity and utility of NLG evaluations over time [14].

However, the development and application of composite metrics present several challenges. One significant issue is the potential for increased complexity in both design and implementation. Integrating multiple sub-metrics requires careful consideration of how each component contributes to the overall score and how discrepancies between them are resolved. Additionally, the interpretability of composite metrics can be compromised, making it difficult for practitioners to understand the underlying causes of performance variations. To address these challenges, researchers have proposed various methodologies for optimizing composite metrics, such as using machine learning techniques to automatically weigh sub-metrics based on their predictive power for human judgments [23]. Another approach involves leveraging crowdsourcing to gather large-scale human feedback, which can then be used to calibrate and validate composite metrics, enhancing their reliability and fairness [4].

Furthermore, the integration of human evaluations into composite metrics offers a promising direction for improving the comprehensiveness of automated assessments. While automated metrics excel in efficiency and scalability, they often fall short in capturing subtle nuances that are better discerned by human evaluators. By combining automated scores with human ratings, composite metrics can achieve a balance between objectivity and subjectivity, providing a more balanced and robust evaluation. For instance, automated metrics can be used to screen out obviously flawed outputs, while human evaluators can then focus on assessing the more sophisticated aspects of the generated text, such as its emotional impact or cultural sensitivity [53].

In conclusion, composite metrics for comprehensive evaluation represent a significant advancement in the field of NLG system assessment. By integrating multiple dimensions of evaluation, these metrics offer a more nuanced and reliable measure of system performance. However, their successful implementation requires addressing challenges related to complexity, interpretability, and the need for continuous adaptation. Through ongoing research and innovation, composite metrics hold the promise of becoming the gold standard for evaluating NLG systems, thereby contributing to the broader goal of advancing natural language generation technologies.
### Human Evaluation Metrics

#### Subjective Assessments
Subjective assessments in the context of human evaluation metrics for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems play a pivotal role in capturing the qualitative aspects of system performance that automated metrics might overlook. These assessments rely heavily on human judgments to gauge the quality, coherence, and naturalness of the generated text. Typically, subjective assessments involve evaluating NLG outputs based on predefined criteria, such as fluency, relevance, informativeness, and accuracy, which can be assessed through various methods like direct rating, comparison tasks, or user surveys.

Direct rating is one of the most straightforward methods used in subjective assessments. In this approach, human evaluators are provided with a set of generated texts along with specific criteria to rate each output on a scale. For instance, fluency might be rated on a five-point Likert scale ranging from "very poor" to "excellent." This method allows evaluators to provide nuanced feedback on multiple dimensions of the generated text, offering insights into areas where the NLG system excels or falls short. However, direct rating also comes with its challenges, particularly in ensuring consistency across different evaluators. Variability in human judgment can lead to inconsistent ratings, making it crucial to train evaluators and establish clear guidelines to mitigate such issues [7].

Comparison tasks represent another valuable method within subjective assessments. Here, evaluators are presented with pairs of generated texts and asked to choose which one is better according to certain criteria. This method not only simplifies the decision-making process for evaluators but also provides a relative measure of performance. Comparison tasks can be particularly useful when dealing with large datasets, as they reduce the cognitive load on evaluators compared to direct rating. However, they require careful design to ensure that the comparisons are fair and representative of the overall quality of the generated texts. Moreover, the choice of criteria for comparison is critical; it should align closely with the intended use of the NLG system to yield meaningful results [21].

User surveys offer a broader perspective on the effectiveness of NLG systems by incorporating end-user feedback. Unlike direct rating and comparison tasks, which focus primarily on linguistic and structural aspects of the generated text, user surveys aim to assess the practical utility and user satisfaction with the system. Surveys can include questions about ease of understanding, usefulness, and overall satisfaction, providing valuable insights into how well the system meets real-world needs. For example, in the context of customer service chatbots, a survey might ask users if the responses were helpful and whether they felt understood during their interaction. While user surveys are less prone to the biases inherent in direct human judgments due to their broader scope, they still require careful design to ensure that the questions are clear and unbiased [26]. Additionally, the interpretation of survey results can be challenging, as open-ended responses may need to be manually coded or analyzed using sentiment analysis techniques to extract meaningful insights.

Despite their importance, subjective assessments face several challenges that can affect their reliability and validity. One significant challenge is the variability in human judgment, which can arise from differences in evaluator expertise, cultural background, or personal preferences. To address this, it is essential to have a diverse group of evaluators and to conduct extensive training sessions to standardize the evaluation process. Another challenge is the potential for bias in subjective assessments, especially when evaluators are influenced by factors unrelated to the actual quality of the generated text. For instance, evaluators might unconsciously favor outputs that resemble human-generated text more closely, leading to a bias against more innovative or unconventional NLG approaches. Mitigating such biases requires a rigorous validation process and the inclusion of control groups in evaluation studies [51].

Furthermore, subjective assessments often struggle with scalability, particularly when dealing with large datasets or real-time applications. Direct rating and comparison tasks can become impractical when the volume of generated text is substantial, as they require considerable time and resources. In such cases, sampling strategies must be employed to ensure that the evaluations remain manageable while still being representative of the entire dataset. Techniques like stratified sampling can help in selecting a representative subset of data for evaluation, ensuring that the results generalize well to the entire dataset [46].

In conclusion, subjective assessments form a vital component of human evaluation metrics for NLG systems, providing rich qualitative insights into system performance. By leveraging methods such as direct rating, comparison tasks, and user surveys, evaluators can capture a comprehensive picture of how well the NLG system functions in practice. However, it is crucial to address the challenges associated with these methods, including variability in human judgment, potential biases, and scalability issues, to ensure that the evaluations are both reliable and valid. As NLG technology continues to evolve, refining subjective assessment techniques will be essential to maintain the integrity and usefulness of human evaluation metrics.
#### Consistency and Reliability
In the context of human evaluation metrics for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, consistency and reliability stand out as critical aspects that ensure the validity and robustness of the evaluation process. Consistency refers to the degree to which evaluators provide similar ratings when assessing the same NLG outputs under identical conditions, while reliability pertains to the stability of the evaluation results over time and across different evaluators. Both concepts are essential for establishing a credible framework for assessing the performance of NLG systems.

Achieving consistency in human evaluations requires careful consideration of several factors. One key factor is the training and calibration of evaluators. It is crucial that all evaluators receive comprehensive training to understand the evaluation criteria and scoring rubrics thoroughly. This ensures that their judgments are based on a shared understanding of what constitutes high-quality NLG output. Furthermore, periodic recalibration sessions can help maintain consistency by refreshing evaluators' knowledge and addressing any discrepancies that may arise over time [7]. Another important aspect is the standardization of the evaluation environment. By ensuring that all evaluators have access to the same set of instructions, tools, and resources, the variability in the evaluation process can be minimized, thereby enhancing consistency.

Reliability in human evaluations is often assessed through various statistical measures, such as inter-rater reliability and test-retest reliability. Inter-rater reliability examines the agreement between different evaluators who assess the same set of NLG outputs. High inter-rater reliability indicates that different evaluators are likely to assign similar scores to the same outputs, thus providing confidence in the evaluation results. Test-retest reliability, on the other hand, evaluates the stability of the evaluation results over time. If evaluators consistently rate the same NLG outputs similarly at different points in time, it suggests that the evaluation process is reliable and not prone to random fluctuations. These measures are vital for validating the credibility of human evaluations and ensuring that the results reflect the true performance of the NLG systems being evaluated [19].

However, achieving both consistency and reliability in human evaluations poses significant challenges. One major challenge is the inherent subjectivity involved in human assessments. Evaluators may bring their own biases and preferences into the evaluation process, leading to inconsistencies in scoring. To mitigate this issue, it is essential to design evaluation criteria that are clear, objective, and well-defined. Additionally, incorporating multiple evaluators and using statistical methods to analyze the data can help identify and address potential biases. Another challenge is the variability in the quality and expertise of evaluators. Ensuring that all evaluators are equally competent and trained can be difficult, especially when dealing with large-scale evaluations involving numerous participants. To overcome this, it is advisable to implement rigorous screening processes and continuous monitoring of evaluator performance.

Moreover, the scalability of human evaluations presents another hurdle. As the number of NLG outputs increases, manually evaluating each one becomes increasingly impractical. To address this, researchers often employ techniques such as sampling and stratified evaluation, where only a subset of the outputs is evaluated. While these methods can reduce the workload, they may compromise the comprehensiveness of the evaluation. Therefore, finding a balance between thoroughness and practicality is crucial. Additionally, integrating automated evaluation metrics alongside human assessments can help manage the scale of evaluations while maintaining the benefits of human judgment.

In conclusion, ensuring consistency and reliability in human evaluations of NLG systems is fundamental to obtaining valid and trustworthy results. Through rigorous training, standardized procedures, and statistical validation, evaluators can provide consistent and reliable assessments. However, the challenges associated with subjectivity, variability, and scalability must be carefully managed to uphold the integrity of the evaluation process. By addressing these challenges, researchers can enhance the accuracy and reliability of human evaluations, ultimately contributing to the advancement of NLG technology.
#### Task-specific Evaluations
Task-specific evaluations in human assessment of NLG systems refer to the tailored methodologies designed to measure system performance relative to specific tasks and domains. These evaluations are crucial because they allow for a nuanced understanding of how well an NLG system can perform in real-world scenarios, taking into account the unique challenges and requirements of each application area. Unlike general evaluation metrics, task-specific evaluations are context-sensitive and often require domain experts to provide feedback and annotations, ensuring that the assessments align with the intended use cases of the NLG outputs.

In the medical diagnosis support domain, for instance, NLG systems are expected to generate reports that accurately summarize patient data and clinical findings. Task-specific evaluations here might involve assessing the systemâ€™s ability to extract relevant information from electronic health records and present it in a coherent, understandable manner to healthcare professionals [31]. This could include evaluating the completeness, accuracy, and readability of the generated text, as well as its utility in supporting diagnostic decision-making. Such evaluations would typically be conducted by medical practitioners who can judge the quality and relevance of the generated content based on their expertise and experience.

Similarly, in automated report generation for financial analysis, task-specific evaluations would focus on the systemâ€™s capacity to produce insightful and actionable summaries of financial data. Metrics used in such evaluations might include the precision of the generated content in reflecting key financial trends and indicators, the clarity of explanations provided for complex financial concepts, and the alignment of the reportâ€™s conclusions with established financial theories and practices [46]. These assessments would likely involve financial analysts or economists who can evaluate the reportsâ€™ adherence to industry standards and their potential impact on investment decisions.

For customer service chatbots, task-specific evaluations would center on the systemâ€™s effectiveness in addressing user inquiries and providing satisfactory responses. Key considerations here might include the systemâ€™s ability to understand user intent, provide accurate and helpful information, and maintain a natural and engaging conversational flow [21]. Evaluators in this context could include customer service representatives or users themselves, who can assess the chatbotâ€™s performance based on real interactions and feedback collected through surveys or direct observation.

The educational content creation domain presents another set of challenges for NLG systems, where the primary goal is to generate learning materials that are pedagogically effective and engaging for students. Task-specific evaluations in this area might involve assessing the systemâ€™s ability to create content that aligns with curriculum standards, adapts to different learning styles, and maintains student interest and engagement [26]. Educational psychologists or teachers with expertise in instructional design would be critical in evaluating these aspects, as they can provide insights into the educational value and practical applicability of the generated content.

One significant challenge in conducting task-specific evaluations is ensuring consistency and reliability across different evaluators and contexts. This issue becomes particularly pronounced when dealing with subjective judgments, such as the quality of prose or the effectiveness of a conversational interaction. To address this, researchers often employ standardized evaluation protocols and training programs for raters, aiming to minimize variability in scoring and ensure that assessments are as objective and fair as possible [38]. Additionally, incorporating multiple evaluators and using statistical methods to aggregate their scores can help mitigate biases and enhance the robustness of the evaluation outcomes.

Another challenge lies in the scalability of task-specific evaluations, especially when dealing with large datasets or high-throughput systems. Traditional human-based evaluation methods can become impractical due to the time and resource constraints involved in manually reviewing extensive volumes of generated text. In response, there has been growing interest in developing hybrid approaches that integrate automated metrics with human assessments. These hybrid methods aim to leverage the strengths of both human and machine evaluations, allowing for more efficient and comprehensive assessments while maintaining the contextual understanding and nuance that only human evaluators can provide [28].

Overall, task-specific evaluations play a pivotal role in refining and improving NLG systems by providing domain-specific insights into their performance and limitations. By tailoring evaluation methods to the unique demands of different applications, researchers and developers can gain a deeper understanding of how NLG systems can best serve their intended purposes, ultimately driving advancements in the field and enhancing the utility of NLG technologies in various sectors.
#### User Feedback and Satisfaction
User feedback and satisfaction play a pivotal role in assessing the effectiveness and usability of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. In the context of human evaluation metrics, user feedback provides direct insights into how well an NLG system meets its intended goals from a practical standpoint. Users interact directly with the outputs of NLG systems, making their perceptions and experiences critical indicators of system performance. Collecting this feedback can be achieved through various methods, such as surveys, interviews, and direct observation, which help capture both quantitative data and qualitative impressions.

Surveys are a common method for gathering user feedback due to their structured nature and ability to reach a large number of participants efficiently. These surveys often include questions designed to measure user satisfaction, perceived usefulness, ease of use, and overall experience with the NLG system. For instance, Likert scale questions can be used to gauge users' agreement or disagreement with statements related to the systemâ€™s performance. Additionally, open-ended questions allow users to provide more detailed comments and suggestions, offering valuable qualitative data that can highlight areas for improvement. The results from these surveys can be statistically analyzed to identify trends and patterns in user feedback, providing a comprehensive view of user satisfaction levels [7].

Interviews offer another avenue for collecting in-depth user feedback. Unlike surveys, interviews allow for a more interactive and exploratory approach, enabling researchers to probe deeper into specific aspects of user experience. Semi-structured interviews can be particularly useful, as they provide a framework within which interviewees can express their thoughts freely while still addressing key areas of interest. This method is especially beneficial when dealing with complex or nuanced user interactions, where detailed explanations can reveal subtleties that might be missed in a survey format. By analyzing interview transcripts, researchers can uncover themes and insights that inform the development and refinement of NLG systems [21].

Direct observation is another important method for evaluating user feedback and satisfaction. This involves observing users as they interact with the NLG system in real-time, either in a controlled laboratory setting or in a natural environment. Observational studies can provide rich, contextual information about how users engage with the system, what challenges they face, and how they perceive the systemâ€™s output. Video recordings and screen captures can serve as valuable tools for capturing these interactions, allowing for detailed analysis post-session. Researchers can note instances where users appear satisfied or frustrated, and correlate these observations with specific features or functionalities of the NLG system. This method is particularly useful for identifying usability issues and understanding the practical implications of NLG outputs in real-world scenarios [38].

The integration of user feedback into the evaluation process is crucial for ensuring that NLG systems meet the needs and expectations of their target audience. However, it also presents several challenges. One major challenge is the variability in user responses, which can be influenced by factors such as individual preferences, cultural background, and prior experience with similar technologies. Ensuring that the collected feedback is representative of the broader user base requires careful consideration of sampling strategies and the inclusion of diverse participant groups. Furthermore, interpreting user feedback accurately and effectively is essential but can be complicated by the subjective nature of user experiences. Researchers must employ rigorous analytical techniques to distill meaningful insights from the data, often involving qualitative coding schemes and statistical analyses to quantify user satisfaction levels [42].

Another significant challenge is the potential for bias in user feedback. Users may provide biased or incomplete feedback due to various reasons, such as social desirability bias or limited understanding of the systemâ€™s capabilities. To mitigate these biases, it is important to design evaluation methods that encourage honest and reflective feedback. For example, anonymity in surveys can reduce social desirability bias, while clear instructions and support during interviews can help users articulate their thoughts more accurately. Additionally, combining multiple feedback sourcesâ€”such as surveys, interviews, and observational studiesâ€”can provide a more robust and balanced perspective on user satisfaction. This multi-faceted approach helps ensure that the evaluation reflects a wide range of user experiences and perspectives, enhancing the reliability and validity of the assessment [51].

In conclusion, user feedback and satisfaction are indispensable components of human evaluation metrics for NLG systems. They provide critical insights into the practical effectiveness and usability of these systems, guiding improvements and informing future developments. While collecting and interpreting this feedback presents challenges, employing a variety of methods and rigorous analytical techniques can help overcome these obstacles, leading to more accurate and comprehensive evaluations. Ultimately, integrating user feedback into the evaluation process is essential for creating NLG systems that truly meet the needs and expectations of their users.
#### Expert Reviews and Annotations
Expert reviews and annotations play a crucial role in human evaluation metrics for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. These methods involve the participation of domain experts who provide detailed assessments based on their specialized knowledge and experience. Unlike general user feedback, expert reviews offer a deeper understanding of the nuances and complexities involved in NLG outputs, thereby enhancing the accuracy and reliability of evaluations.

The process of expert review typically involves having domain experts analyze the generated text against specific criteria relevant to their field. For instance, in medical diagnosis support systems, experts might evaluate the generated reports based on clinical relevance, adherence to diagnostic protocols, and the clarity of the information provided [31]. Similarly, in financial statement analysis, financial analysts would assess the generated content for accuracy, completeness, and compliance with regulatory standards. The expertise of these reviewers ensures that the evaluation is not only comprehensive but also grounded in practical applications and real-world scenarios.

Annotations are another essential component of expert evaluations. They involve providing detailed comments and ratings for various aspects of the generated text. These annotations can be quantitative, such as rating scales, or qualitative, involving descriptive feedback. For example, an expert might annotate a piece of text with notes on areas where the system excelled or fell short, along with suggestions for improvement. This dual approach of reviewing and annotating provides a rich dataset that can be used to refine and improve NLG systems. Additionally, annotations facilitate a more systematic and standardized evaluation process, reducing variability and ensuring consistency across different evaluators.

One significant advantage of using expert reviews and annotations is their ability to address task-specific requirements effectively. Unlike general-purpose metrics, which may not capture all the intricacies of specialized tasks, expert evaluations can tailor the assessment criteria to fit the specific needs of the application. For instance, in automated report generation, experts can focus on the coherence, readability, and informativeness of the generated reports, while in customer service chatbots, they can evaluate the systemâ€™s ability to handle diverse customer inquiries and maintain a natural conversational flow [7]. This task-specific approach ensures that the evaluation is both relevant and meaningful within the context of the intended use case.

However, implementing expert reviews and annotations also comes with challenges. One major issue is the scalability of the evaluation process. As NLG systems generate vast amounts of text, it becomes impractical to have every output reviewed by an expert. To address this, researchers often employ sampling techniques, selecting representative subsets of data for expert evaluation. Another challenge is ensuring the reliability and validity of the evaluations. Since expert judgments can be subjective, it is important to establish clear guidelines and training programs for reviewers to minimize bias and ensure consistent assessments. Additionally, the cost and time required for expert evaluations can be substantial, making it necessary to balance thoroughness with efficiency.

Despite these challenges, expert reviews and annotations remain invaluable tools for assessing NLG systems. They provide a nuanced understanding of system performance and help identify areas for improvement that might be overlooked by automated metrics. Furthermore, integrating expert evaluations into hybrid approaches can enhance the comprehensiveness and robustness of overall evaluation strategies. By combining the strengths of automated metrics with the insights provided by experts, researchers and practitioners can develop more effective and reliable NLG systems that meet the diverse needs of various applications [28].
### Hybrid Evaluation Approaches

#### Integration of Automated and Human Evaluations
The integration of automated and human evaluations represents a significant advancement in the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. This hybrid approach leverages the strengths of both methods to provide a comprehensive assessment of NLG system performance. Automated metrics, such as those based on linguistic features, semantic similarity, statistical measures, and novelty assessments, offer efficient and scalable ways to evaluate large datasets. However, they often fall short in capturing the nuances and complexities that human evaluators can detect through subjective judgment and contextual understanding.

One of the primary advantages of integrating automated and human evaluations is the ability to validate and complement each other's findings. Automated metrics can identify patterns and discrepancies at scale, providing a broad overview of system performance. Conversely, human evaluations can pinpoint specific areas where automated metrics might fail to capture meaningful differences, such as in the evaluation of coherence, fluency, and relevance. For instance, while automated metrics like BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) or ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) can quantify overlap between generated text and reference texts, they may not adequately assess the quality of generated text in terms of its informativeness or readability. Human evaluators can address these limitations by offering qualitative feedback that highlights the strengths and weaknesses of the generated content.

To effectively integrate automated and human evaluations, it is crucial to establish clear guidelines and methodologies that ensure consistency and reliability across different evaluators and automated tools. One effective strategy is to use a combination of quantitative scores from automated metrics alongside qualitative assessments from human evaluators. This dual approach allows for a more nuanced understanding of system performance, as it combines objective measurements with subjective insights. For example, a study by [54] explores the challenges and opportunities in using large language models (LLMs) for NLG evaluation, highlighting the importance of combining automated metrics with human judgments to achieve a balanced assessment.

Another key aspect of integrating automated and human evaluations is the development of adaptive hybrid approaches that can adjust to varying contexts and domains. Different applications of NLG systems, such as medical diagnosis support or financial statement analysis, require tailored evaluation strategies that account for domain-specific requirements and constraints. Adaptive hybrid methods can dynamically incorporate relevant automated metrics and human evaluations based on the specific needs of the application. For instance, in medical diagnosis support, automated metrics focused on semantic similarity and consistency can be combined with human evaluations that emphasize clinical relevance and patient comprehension. Such an approach ensures that the evaluation process is both robust and contextually appropriate.

Implementing hybrid evaluation methods also presents several challenges that need to be addressed to ensure their effectiveness. One major challenge is the potential variability in human judgments, which can introduce inconsistencies into the evaluation process. To mitigate this issue, it is essential to train evaluators thoroughly and establish standardized protocols for scoring and feedback. Additionally, ensuring fairness and bias mitigation in both automated and human evaluations is critical. Automated metrics must be designed to avoid reinforcing existing biases, while human evaluators should be trained to recognize and minimize their own biases. Furthermore, scalability remains a concern, particularly when dealing with large-scale NLG systems that generate vast amounts of text. Innovative solutions, such as active learning techniques [19], can help reduce the reliance on extensive human evaluations by focusing on the most informative comparisons.

In conclusion, the integration of automated and human evaluations offers a powerful framework for assessing NLG systems comprehensively. By leveraging the strengths of both methods, researchers and practitioners can gain deeper insights into system performance and identify areas for improvement. While there are challenges associated with implementing hybrid approaches, addressing these through careful design and rigorous validation can lead to more reliable and effective evaluation practices. Ultimately, the successful integration of automated and human evaluations holds the promise of advancing the field of NLG and enhancing the utility of NLG systems across various applications.
#### Combining Metrics for Comprehensive Assessment
Combining Metrics for Comprehensive Assessment represents a sophisticated approach in the evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. By integrating multiple types of evaluation metricsâ€”both quantitative and qualitative, as well as task-specific and composite measuresâ€”a more holistic understanding of system performance can be achieved. This multifaceted assessment method not only captures various dimensions of NLG output quality but also enhances the reliability and validity of evaluation results.

Quantitative metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, which primarily measure the lexical overlap between generated text and human references, provide a statistical basis for comparison. However, they often fall short in capturing the semantic accuracy and coherence of the generated text. On the other hand, qualitative metrics like human judgments offer insights into aspects such as fluency, informativeness, and engagement, which are crucial for assessing the overall quality of NLG outputs. By combining these two types of metrics, evaluators can obtain a balanced view of both the structural similarity and the semantic fidelity of generated texts [54].

Task-specific metrics further refine this assessment by focusing on the particular requirements of different NLG applications. For instance, in medical diagnosis support systems, it is essential to ensure that the generated reports accurately reflect patient conditions and clinical findings [45]. In contrast, customer service chatbots might prioritize generating responses that are contextually relevant and capable of addressing user queries effectively. Composite metrics, which integrate multiple evaluation criteria, offer a more comprehensive assessment by considering a range of factors simultaneously. These metrics can be particularly useful in scenarios where NLG systems need to perform multiple tasks or generate text across diverse contexts [40].

The integration of automated and human evaluations within hybrid approaches offers several advantages over standalone methods. Automated metrics, while efficient and scalable, are limited in their ability to capture nuanced aspects of language generation. They often rely on predefined rules or statistical patterns, which may not fully align with human perception and judgment. Conversely, human evaluations, though subjective and potentially inconsistent, can provide valuable insights into the perceptual quality and utility of NLG outputs. By leveraging the strengths of both automated and human evaluations, hybrid approaches aim to achieve a more robust and reliable assessment framework [19].

One key challenge in combining metrics for comprehensive assessment lies in the variability of evaluation outcomes across different domains and contexts. For example, the effectiveness of certain metrics may vary significantly depending on the specific application domain, such as healthcare, finance, or education. Additionally, the scalability of evaluation processes becomes critical when dealing with large-scale datasets or real-time applications. To address these challenges, researchers have explored the use of synthetic data and adaptive hybrid approaches that dynamically adjust the weightage of different metrics based on contextual factors [28]. Such approaches not only enhance the adaptability of evaluation frameworks but also improve their relevance and applicability across diverse NLG scenarios.

Moreover, ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in NLG evaluation remains a significant concern. Biases can inadvertently be introduced through the choice of evaluation metrics, the composition of reference corpora, or the demographic characteristics of human evaluators. Therefore, it is crucial to develop evaluation methodologies that account for potential biases and strive for equitable assessments. For instance, incorporating diverse sets of reference texts and evaluators can help mitigate the risk of biased evaluations [123]. Furthermore, integrating multimodal evaluation techniques that consider both linguistic and non-linguistic aspects of NLG outputs can provide a more balanced perspective and reduce reliance on potentially biased linguistic features [48].

In conclusion, combining metrics for comprehensive assessment in hybrid evaluation approaches represents a promising direction for advancing NLG evaluation techniques. By integrating multiple types of metrics and leveraging both automated and human evaluations, these approaches offer a more nuanced and reliable assessment framework. Addressing challenges related to variability, scalability, and bias is essential for ensuring the robustness and fairness of evaluation processes. As NLG technology continues to evolve, the development of more sophisticated and adaptable evaluation methodologies will be crucial for supporting the effective deployment and improvement of NLG systems across various applications and domains.
#### Adaptive Hybrid Approaches Based on Context
Adaptive hybrid approaches based on context represent a sophisticated methodology aimed at leveraging both automated and human evaluation metrics dynamically, depending on the specific requirements and characteristics of the Natural Language Generation (NLG) system being assessed. These approaches recognize that different contexts and applications demand varying levels of precision and comprehensiveness in evaluation. By integrating adaptive mechanisms, evaluators can tailor their assessment strategies to better capture the nuances of NLG outputs, ensuring a more accurate and relevant evaluation.

In traditional hybrid methods, a fixed combination of automated and human evaluations is often employed, which may not always align perfectly with the unique demands of each scenario. For instance, when evaluating an NLG system designed for medical diagnosis support, where precision and reliability are paramount, a static hybrid approach might overlook subtle yet critical differences between automated and human judgments. Adaptive hybrid approaches address this limitation by incorporating contextual factors into the evaluation process. These factors could include the domain specificity, the complexity of the task, the availability of training data, and the intended audience for the generated text. By doing so, these approaches enable a more flexible and responsive evaluation framework that can adapt to the varying needs of different applications.

One key aspect of adaptive hybrid approaches is the dynamic allocation of resources between automated and human evaluations. In scenarios where automated metrics are deemed insufficient due to the high complexity or variability of the NLG output, more human evaluations can be introduced to provide deeper insights. Conversely, in situations where automated metrics offer sufficient coverage and reliability, the reliance on human evaluations can be minimized, thereby optimizing resource utilization. This dynamic allocation is particularly beneficial in large-scale applications where the sheer volume of NLG outputs necessitates efficient evaluation processes. For example, in automated report generation systems, where thousands of reports are generated daily, an adaptive approach can ensure that the most critical aspects of the reports are rigorously evaluated without overwhelming human evaluators.

Another critical component of adaptive hybrid approaches is the integration of contextual information into the evaluation criteria. This involves tailoring the evaluation metrics to reflect the specific challenges and goals of the NLG application. For instance, in customer service chatbots, the emphasis might be on the system's ability to maintain conversational coherence and provide accurate responses across diverse user queries. In such cases, metrics that assess dialogue quality, relevance, and engagement would be prioritized over generic language fluency scores. Similarly, in educational content creation, the evaluation might focus more on the clarity and pedagogical effectiveness of the generated material, rather than purely linguistic correctness. By adapting the evaluation criteria based on context, these approaches enhance the relevance and applicability of the evaluation outcomes.

Moreover, adaptive hybrid approaches facilitate the development of more robust and versatile evaluation frameworks through continuous learning and adaptation. As new data becomes available and as the NLG system evolves, the evaluation criteria and methodologies can be refined to better reflect the current state and performance of the system. This iterative process allows for the identification and mitigation of potential biases and limitations in the evaluation methods themselves. For example, initial evaluations might reveal that certain automated metrics are overly sensitive to stylistic variations, leading to an adjustment in the evaluation strategy to incorporate more nuanced qualitative assessments. Such continuous refinement ensures that the evaluation remains aligned with the evolving capabilities and applications of the NLG system.

In conclusion, adaptive hybrid approaches based on context offer a promising direction for enhancing the accuracy and relevance of NLG system evaluations. By dynamically integrating automated and human evaluations and tailoring the evaluation criteria to the specific needs of each application, these approaches provide a more comprehensive and adaptable evaluation framework. As highlighted in recent studies [29, 65], the active and adaptive nature of these methods can significantly improve the efficiency and effectiveness of NLG evaluations, paving the way for more reliable and insightful assessments in various domains.
#### Challenges in Implementing Hybrid Methods
Implementing hybrid evaluation methods for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems combines the strengths of both automated and human evaluations, aiming to provide a comprehensive assessment of system performance. However, this integration comes with its own set of challenges that need to be carefully managed to ensure the effectiveness and reliability of the evaluation process.

One significant challenge in implementing hybrid evaluation approaches is achieving consistency between automated and human assessments. Automated metrics, such as BLEU or ROUGE scores, often rely on statistical measures of similarity between generated text and reference texts, which can sometimes diverge significantly from human judgments. For instance, automated metrics might score highly on syntactic accuracy but fail to capture semantic coherence or stylistic nuances that humans value [19]. Conversely, human evaluations are subjective and can vary widely based on individual biases, making it difficult to establish a consistent baseline for comparison. To address this, researchers have explored methods like active evaluation, where a small number of pairwise comparisons between machine-generated and human-written texts are used to guide the selection of more representative samples for human assessment [19]. However, even with such strategies, ensuring that automated and human evaluations align consistently remains a complex task.

Another challenge is the scalability of hybrid evaluation methods, particularly when dealing with large datasets or real-time applications. While automated metrics can handle vast amounts of data efficiently, integrating human feedback requires substantial time and resources. For example, evaluating the performance of a customer service chatbot in real-time would necessitate continuous human oversight, which is impractical at scale [3]. Automated methods, on the other hand, might struggle with the variability and complexity of real-world interactions, leading to inaccurate assessments. One potential solution involves using synthetic data to train and test automated evaluation metrics, thereby reducing the need for extensive human input while still validating the model's performance across diverse scenarios [28]. However, generating high-quality synthetic data that accurately reflects real-world conditions is itself a non-trivial task and can introduce additional biases if not carefully controlled.

Furthermore, hybrid evaluation methods face the challenge of handling out-of-distribution data, where the input data differs significantly from the training data. In NLG systems, this can occur due to changes in context, domain, or user preferences over time. For instance, a medical diagnosis support system might encounter new types of cases that were not present during the initial development phase [34]. Automated metrics trained on a specific dataset might fail to generalize well to these new scenarios, leading to misleading evaluations. Similarly, human evaluators might lack the necessary expertise to judge the quality of responses in unfamiliar contexts, resulting in inconsistent or unreliable assessments. To mitigate this issue, researchers have proposed adaptive hybrid approaches that dynamically adjust the weight given to automated and human evaluations based on the confidence level of the automated metric [45]. However, developing such adaptive mechanisms requires careful calibration and validation to ensure they perform reliably across different contexts.

Lastly, ensuring fairness and bias mitigation is another critical challenge in implementing hybrid evaluation methods. Both automated and human evaluations can inadvertently perpetuate existing biases, either through the design of evaluation metrics or the selection of human evaluators. For example, automated metrics might favor certain linguistic styles or content types, leading to biased evaluations [54]. Similarly, human evaluators might unconsciously apply different standards based on factors such as the demographic characteristics of the authors or the content being evaluated. To address these issues, it is essential to incorporate fairness considerations into the design and implementation of hybrid evaluation methods. This could involve using diverse datasets for training automated metrics, ensuring that human evaluators are trained on unbiased evaluation criteria, and employing techniques like debiasing algorithms to correct for any observed biases [48]. However, achieving true fairness in evaluation requires ongoing monitoring and adjustment as new biases emerge or existing ones evolve.

In conclusion, while hybrid evaluation approaches offer a promising way to comprehensively assess NLG systems, they also present several challenges that must be carefully addressed. Achieving consistency between automated and human evaluations, scaling the approach to handle large datasets, adapting to out-of-distribution data, and ensuring fairness and bias mitigation are all critical considerations. By addressing these challenges through innovative methodologies and rigorous testing, researchers and practitioners can develop more robust and reliable evaluation frameworks for NLG systems.
#### Case Studies Demonstrating Hybrid Effectiveness
Case studies demonstrating the effectiveness of hybrid evaluation approaches provide valuable insights into how automated and human evaluations can be integrated to achieve comprehensive assessments of NLG systems. One such case study involves the application of hybrid evaluation techniques in medical diagnosis support systems. In this scenario, NLG systems are used to generate reports based on patient data, which must be both linguistically coherent and semantically accurate to ensure effective communication between healthcare providers and patients.

In a study conducted by Elizabeth Bismut and Daniel Straub [45], the authors explored the use of hybrid evaluation methods in natural language generation for medical diagnosis support. They utilized a combination of automated metrics focused on linguistic features and semantic similarity alongside human evaluations to assess the quality of generated medical reports. Automated metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) were employed to measure the textual coherence and fluency of the generated text. These metrics provided quantitative scores that indicated the extent to which the NLG output matched reference texts. Additionally, semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore [48] were applied to evaluate the contextual accuracy of the generated reports. BERTScore, based on the BERT model, offers a more nuanced assessment by considering the context and meaning of the generated text relative to the reference texts.

To complement the automated evaluations, subjective human assessments were also performed. Medical professionals were asked to review the generated reports and provide feedback on their clarity, informativeness, and overall usefulness. This human evaluation component was crucial in capturing the qualitative aspects of the NLG output that automated metrics might overlook. For instance, while automated metrics could identify grammatical errors and lexical overlap, they might not detect issues related to the logical flow of information or the relevance of the content to the specific medical context. By integrating human evaluations, the researchers were able to obtain a more holistic understanding of the system's performance.

Another illustrative case study comes from the domain of automated report generation, where hybrid evaluation approaches have been applied to assess the quality of financial statement analysis tools. In this context, NLG systems are tasked with generating financial reports that summarize key metrics and trends derived from complex datasets. A study by Mingqi Gao and colleagues [54] investigated the integration of automated and human evaluation metrics in this setting. Automated metrics such as METEOR (Metric for Evaluation of Translation with Explicit ORdering), which measures the alignment between the generated text and reference summaries, were used to gauge the precision and recall of the NLG output. Furthermore, statistical metrics like perplexity and cross-entropy were employed to evaluate the coherence and diversity of the generated reports.

Human evaluations were conducted using a panel of financial analysts who assessed the generated reports based on criteria such as readability, comprehensibility, and the ability to convey critical financial insights effectively. These experts were particularly adept at identifying subtle nuances in the reporting that could impact decision-making processes. For example, they could discern whether the NLG system accurately captured the essence of financial trends without oversimplifying or misrepresenting the data. The combination of automated and human evaluations allowed for a balanced assessment that accounted for both quantitative and qualitative dimensions of the NLG output.

The hybrid approach demonstrated its effectiveness in addressing some of the inherent challenges associated with NLG evaluation. For instance, one of the significant challenges in evaluating NLG systems is ensuring fairness and mitigating bias. By incorporating human evaluations, the risk of biased automated metrics was reduced, as human reviewers could bring diverse perspectives and contextual knowledge to the assessment process. Moreover, the scalability issue often encountered in purely human-based evaluations was mitigated through the use of automated metrics, which enabled the rapid processing of large volumes of generated text.

In summary, the case studies highlighted the benefits of adopting hybrid evaluation approaches in assessing NLG systems across different domains. The integration of automated and human evaluations provided a more comprehensive and reliable assessment framework that leveraged the strengths of both methods. Automated metrics offered efficient and standardized quantitative assessments, while human evaluations ensured the capture of qualitative and context-specific aspects of NLG performance. These findings underscore the importance of continued research into the development and refinement of hybrid evaluation techniques to enhance the robustness and reliability of NLG systems.
### Challenges in NLG Evaluation

#### Subjectivity in Human Judgments
Subjectivity in human judgments poses a significant challenge in the evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. Despite the advancements in automated metrics, human evaluations remain indispensable due to their ability to capture nuances that quantitative measures often miss. However, the inherent variability in human perception can introduce inconsistencies and biases into the evaluation process, complicating efforts to achieve reliable and consistent assessments.

One of the primary issues with human judgment is its susceptibility to individual biases and preferences. These biases can stem from various factors, such as personal background, cultural context, or even the specific task at hand. For instance, a human evaluator might favor certain linguistic styles or syntactic structures over others based on their own communicative habits or aesthetic preferences. Such biases can skew the evaluation results, making it difficult to draw accurate conclusions about the performance of NLG systems across different contexts and applications [1].

Moreover, the subjective nature of human judgment introduces variability in how different evaluators interpret and assess the same output. This variability can be exacerbated when evaluators are tasked with assessing complex or nuanced outputs, where multiple valid interpretations may exist. In such cases, inter-rater reliability becomes a critical concern, as discrepancies between evaluators can significantly impact the overall assessment of an NLG system's performance. Ensuring consistency among evaluators requires rigorous training and standardized guidelines, but even then, achieving high levels of agreement remains challenging [23].

Another challenge related to human judgment is the potential for cognitive biases to influence the evaluation process. Cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias or anchoring effects, can lead evaluators to interpret information in ways that align with their preconceived notions rather than objective criteria. For example, if an evaluator has prior experience with a particular NLG system, they might unconsciously favor or disfavor outputs based on this prior knowledge, rather than purely on the quality of the generated text. Such biases can distort the evaluation outcomes and undermine the validity of the assessment [13].

Addressing the issue of subjectivity in human judgments requires a multifaceted approach. One promising direction involves integrating automated metrics to complement human evaluations. Automated metrics, which are less prone to subjective biases, can provide a more objective baseline against which human judgments can be calibrated. For instance, metrics based on linguistic features or statistical analysis can help standardize the evaluation process and reduce the impact of individual biases. However, while automated metrics offer valuable insights, they cannot fully replace human evaluations, as they often fail to capture the qualitative aspects of language generation that are crucial for comprehensive assessment [7].

Furthermore, enhancing the reliability of human evaluations through methodological improvements is another key strategy. This includes developing standardized evaluation protocols that minimize the influence of individual biases and ensure consistency across different evaluators. Training evaluators to recognize and mitigate their own biases, as well as providing them with clear and detailed guidelines for assessment, can also contribute to more reliable evaluations. Additionally, employing techniques such as cross-validation and peer review can help identify and correct inconsistencies in the evaluation process, thereby improving the overall robustness of human judgments [19].

In conclusion, while human judgment remains essential for evaluating the quality and effectiveness of NLG systems, the inherent subjectivity of this approach presents significant challenges. Addressing these challenges requires a combination of methodological rigor, integration of automated metrics, and continuous improvement in evaluation practices. By adopting a more systematic and standardized approach to human evaluations, researchers and practitioners can work towards achieving more reliable and consistent assessments of NLG systems, ultimately advancing the field of natural language generation.
#### Variability Across Different Domains
Variability across different domains poses a significant challenge in evaluating NLG systems. Each domain has its unique requirements, terminologies, and contexts that must be considered when assessing the performance of NLG models. For instance, the medical field demands precision, clarity, and adherence to clinical guidelines, whereas creative writing might prioritize originality and emotional engagement. This inherent variability necessitates the development of domain-specific evaluation metrics that can accurately capture the nuances of each application area.

One of the primary challenges in adapting evaluation metrics to different domains is ensuring that the metrics are both relevant and effective. In the medical domain, for example, NLG systems are often used to generate patient reports, summaries of medical records, and even diagnostic recommendations. These tasks require high accuracy and consistency, as errors can have serious consequences. Metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation), which are commonly used in machine translation and summarization tasks, may not be sufficient for evaluating the effectiveness of medical NLG outputs due to their reliance on surface-level features like n-gram overlap [1]. Instead, domain-specific metrics that incorporate semantic accuracy, coherence, and compliance with medical guidelines are necessary. For instance, the Medical Language Understanding Evaluation (MLUE) framework provides a set of criteria tailored to the evaluation of medical text generation systems [24].

Similarly, in the financial domain, NLG systems are employed to generate reports, market analyses, and investment advice. Here, the emphasis is on providing clear, concise, and actionable insights based on complex data. Metrics that assess the readability, informativeness, and relevance of the generated text become crucial. However, these metrics need to be adapted to account for the specific jargon and structures typical of financial documents. For example, a study by [30] highlights the importance of incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the evaluation process to ensure that the generated financial reports meet the standards expected by industry professionals.

The variability in domain requirements also extends to less structured fields such as social media and creative writing. In these domains, NLG systems are tasked with generating content that resonates with human readers and conveys emotions effectively. Traditional quantitative metrics that focus solely on linguistic features may fail to capture the quality of the generated text in terms of its emotional impact and engagement. Therefore, qualitative metrics that involve human judgments become essential. However, these metrics are inherently subjective and can vary widely depending on the individual evaluatorâ€™s preferences and cultural background. To address this, it is important to develop standardized protocols for collecting and aggregating human evaluations to minimize bias and variability [49].

Moreover, the variability across different domains necessitates the consideration of task-specific metrics that can adapt to the unique characteristics of each application. For instance, in educational content creation, NLG systems are used to generate personalized learning materials, assessments, and feedback. Here, the focus is on generating content that is pedagogically sound, engaging, and tailored to the learnerâ€™s needs. Metrics that evaluate the alignment of the generated content with educational objectives, the level of personalization, and the overall effectiveness in promoting learning outcomes are critical. A study by [39] emphasizes the importance of integrating fairness and trustworthiness into the evaluation of predictive models in healthcare, suggesting that similar considerations should be extended to the evaluation of NLG systems in educational settings.

Finally, the challenge of domain variability underscores the need for comprehensive and adaptive evaluation frameworks that can accommodate the diverse requirements of different applications. While automated metrics provide a scalable solution for large-scale evaluations, they often fall short in capturing the complexities of real-world NLG tasks. On the other hand, human evaluations offer valuable insights but are time-consuming and prone to bias. Hybrid approaches that integrate both automated and human evaluations have shown promise in addressing these limitations. However, the effectiveness of these approaches depends heavily on the ability to adapt the evaluation criteria and methods to the specific domain and task at hand. As highlighted by [47], ensuring the reliability and trustworthiness of NLG systems requires a multifaceted evaluation strategy that considers both technical performance and human-centric factors.

In conclusion, the variability across different domains presents a significant challenge in evaluating NLG systems. Developing domain-specific evaluation metrics, integrating task-specific criteria, and adopting hybrid evaluation approaches are essential steps towards overcoming these challenges. By tailoring evaluation methods to the unique requirements of each application area, researchers and practitioners can ensure that NLG systems meet the highest standards of quality, reliability, and effectiveness in their intended domains.
#### Scalability Issues in Evaluation Processes
Scalability issues in evaluation processes represent one of the significant challenges faced in the domain of Natural Language Generation (NLG). As NLG systems grow in complexity and scope, the need for efficient and effective evaluation methods becomes paramount. Traditional evaluation techniques often rely heavily on human assessments, which can be time-consuming and resource-intensive, particularly when dealing with large datasets or frequent updates to the NLG models.

The primary challenge in scaling human evaluations lies in maintaining consistency and reliability across evaluators. Human evaluators can introduce variability due to personal biases, fatigue, and differences in interpretation of evaluation criteria. For instance, studies have shown that even when provided with clear guidelines, human evaluators can produce inconsistent results [23]. This inconsistency can be exacerbated when multiple evaluators are involved, each potentially interpreting the same metric differently. To mitigate this issue, efforts have been made to standardize evaluation protocols and training materials for evaluators. However, such measures still require significant investment in terms of time and resources, making them less feasible for rapid iterations or real-time performance monitoring of NLG systems.

Another aspect of scalability pertains to the sheer volume of data that modern NLG systems generate. As NLG applications expand into areas like automated report generation, educational content creation, and customer service chatbots, the amount of text produced daily can reach enormous proportions. Manually evaluating such vast amounts of output is impractical and often unfeasible. Automated evaluation metrics offer a potential solution to this problem by enabling faster and more consistent assessments. However, the development and validation of robust automated metrics themselves pose significant challenges. Automated metrics must accurately reflect the nuances of language quality, coherence, and relevance, which can be difficult to capture through statistical or linguistic features alone. Moreover, these metrics often require extensive training data and computational resources, which can further complicate their scalability [1].

Furthermore, the integration of multimodal inputs and outputs adds another layer of complexity to the scalability challenge. Many contemporary NLG systems are designed to interact with visual, auditory, and textual information simultaneously. Evaluating the effectiveness of such systems requires assessing not only the textual output but also its interaction with other modalities. This multidimensional evaluation framework increases the intricacy of the evaluation process, making it harder to scale effectively. For example, a system that generates captions for images must be evaluated based on both the accuracy of the text and its alignment with the visual content. Such evaluations demand specialized tools and methods that can handle the interplay between different modalities, adding to the overall complexity and resource requirements [19].

To address these scalability issues, researchers and practitioners are exploring hybrid approaches that combine automated and human evaluations. These hybrid methods aim to leverage the strengths of both types of evaluation while mitigating their respective weaknesses. Automated metrics can provide quick and consistent assessments over large datasets, whereas human evaluations can offer deeper insights into qualitative aspects of NLG output. However, integrating these two forms of evaluation seamlessly remains a challenge. Ensuring that automated metrics accurately reflect human judgments and that human evaluations are conducted efficiently and consistently requires careful calibration and validation processes [47].

Moreover, the context in which NLG systems operate can significantly influence the scalability of evaluation processes. Different domains, such as medical diagnosis support or financial statement analysis, may have unique requirements and constraints that affect how evaluations are conducted. For instance, in medical applications, the stakes are high, and any errors in generated text could have severe consequences. Therefore, evaluations in such contexts need to be rigorous and thorough, which can be difficult to achieve at scale without compromising quality [15]. Additionally, the dynamic nature of some domains, such as customer service, where feedback is constantly changing, necessitates flexible and adaptive evaluation strategies that can keep up with evolving user needs and expectations.

In conclusion, addressing scalability issues in NLG evaluation processes requires a multifaceted approach that considers both technical and human factors. While automated metrics offer promising solutions for handling large volumes of data, they must be carefully calibrated and validated to ensure they align with human judgments. Meanwhile, human evaluations remain essential for capturing nuanced aspects of NLG performance, but they need to be streamlined and standardized to maintain consistency and reliability. Ultimately, the development of scalable evaluation frameworks that can adapt to diverse contexts and applications will be crucial for advancing the field of NLG and ensuring the effective deployment of these systems in real-world scenarios.
#### Handling of Out-of-Distribution Data
Handling out-of-distribution (OOD) data is one of the critical challenges in evaluating Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. OOD data refers to instances that lie outside the distribution of the training data, which can pose significant issues when assessing the performance of NLG models. These instances often include rare or unseen scenarios that the system has not been trained on, making it difficult to predict how well the model will perform under such conditions. For instance, a medical diagnosis support system might encounter symptoms or patient histories that were not present in its training dataset, potentially leading to unreliable or erroneous outputs.

The problem of OOD data is exacerbated by the fact that many existing evaluation metrics are designed primarily for in-distribution data and may fail to accurately reflect the performance of an NLG system when faced with novel inputs. Traditional metrics such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, which rely heavily on n-gram overlap between the generated text and human-written references, often struggle to capture the nuances and complexities inherent in OOD scenarios. As noted by [20], out-of-distribution testing can reveal unexpected behaviors in NLG systems, highlighting the need for robust evaluation methods that can handle diverse and unpredictable input data.

One approach to addressing the challenge of OOD data involves developing specialized evaluation techniques that are specifically tailored to assess the systemâ€™s ability to generalize beyond the training distribution. For example, [3] discusses the importance of out-of-sample testing for Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), suggesting that similar principles could be applied to NLG systems to evaluate their performance on unseen data. Such methods typically involve generating or collecting datasets that are representative of potential OOD scenarios and using these datasets to test the robustness and reliability of the NLG system. This approach not only helps in identifying the limitations of current models but also provides insights into areas where further improvements are needed.

Another promising direction is the use of multimodal evaluation techniques that integrate multiple types of information, such as visual, textual, and contextual cues, to provide a more comprehensive assessment of NLG performance. [32] highlights the importance of considering various aspects of performance, including trustworthiness and clinical suitability, when evaluating language models like GPT-3.5. Extending this idea to NLG systems, a multimodal framework could incorporate both linguistic and contextual features to better understand how the system handles OOD data. For example, a medical report generation system could be evaluated not just based on the textual quality of the reports but also on how well the generated content aligns with visual evidence or other contextual factors.

Moreover, adaptive hybrid approaches that combine automated and human evaluations can offer a more nuanced understanding of NLG performance across different distributions of data. [19] introduces the concept of active evaluation, where few pairwise comparisons between human-generated and machine-generated texts are used to refine the evaluation process. Applying this methodology to OOD data could help in identifying specific areas where the NLG system struggles and where additional training data or algorithmic improvements are necessary. Additionally, integrating expert reviews and user feedback can provide valuable insights into the practical implications of OOD performance, ensuring that the evaluation reflects real-world usage scenarios.

Despite these advancements, several challenges remain in effectively handling OOD data in NLG evaluation. One major issue is the variability and unpredictability of what constitutes OOD data, which can make it difficult to design comprehensive and representative test sets. Another challenge is the computational cost associated with generating and evaluating large volumes of OOD data, especially for complex applications like medical diagnostics or financial analysis. Furthermore, there is a need for standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks that can facilitate consistent and reliable assessment across different domains and applications. Initiatives like the STAGER checklist [49] aim to address some of these issues by providing standardized guidelines for evaluating generative AI reliability, but further development and refinement are necessary to fully address the complexities of OOD data in NLG systems.

In conclusion, the challenge of handling OOD data in NLG evaluation requires a multifaceted approach that integrates advanced evaluation techniques, multimodal assessment frameworks, and adaptive hybrid methods. By focusing on these areas, researchers and practitioners can develop more robust and reliable NLG systems capable of performing effectively in a wide range of real-world scenarios.
#### Ensuring Fairness and Bias Mitigation
Ensuring fairness and bias mitigation in the evaluation of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems is a critical challenge that has garnered significant attention in recent years. As NLG technologies become increasingly prevalent in various applications, such as customer service chatbots, educational content creation, and medical diagnosis support, the potential for biased outcomes becomes more pronounced. Biased evaluations can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups, perpetuate existing societal inequalities, and undermine the trustworthiness and reliability of these systems.

One of the primary sources of bias in NLG evaluation stems from the datasets used for training and testing these systems. If these datasets are skewed towards certain demographics, the resulting models may perform well on the data they were trained on but poorly when encountering diverse or underrepresented groups. For instance, a study by Mucun Tian and Michael D. Ekstrand highlights the issue of estimating error and bias in offline evaluation results, emphasizing the importance of considering the representativeness of datasets [13]. Ensuring that evaluation datasets are inclusive and reflective of real-world diversity is essential to mitigate this form of bias.

Moreover, human evaluators themselves can introduce biases into the evaluation process. Human judgments are inherently subjective and can be influenced by personal biases, cultural backgrounds, and social contexts. To address this, it is crucial to implement rigorous consistency and reliability measures in human evaluations. This includes training evaluators to recognize and mitigate their own biases, using standardized evaluation guidelines, and employing multiple raters to reduce variability in assessments. A study by Jie Ruan, Wenqing Wang, and Xiaojun Wan discusses the need to define and detect vulnerability in human evaluation guidelines, aiming to enhance the reliability of NLG evaluations [23]. Such efforts help ensure that the evaluation process is as objective and fair as possible.

Another key aspect of ensuring fairness and bias mitigation involves addressing out-of-distribution data, which refers to data that falls outside the distribution seen during training. This can pose a significant challenge for NLG systems, particularly when evaluating their performance across different domains or scenarios. For example, a system trained on financial statement analysis might struggle when applied to medical diagnosis support due to the vastly different types of data involved. Ensuring that NLG systems are robust and fair across a wide range of data distributions is therefore critical. The study by Damien Teney et al. provides an insightful example of how out-of-distribution testing can reveal issues related to Goodhart's Law, where metrics designed to measure one thing end up measuring something else entirely, leading to misleading conclusions about system performance [20].

Furthermore, the integration of multimodal evaluation techniques offers promising avenues for enhancing fairness and bias mitigation in NLG systems. Traditional NLG evaluations often rely solely on text-based metrics, which may not capture the full complexity of real-world interactions. Incorporating visual, auditory, and other modalities can provide a more comprehensive assessment of system performance and fairness. For instance, in the context of medical imaging diagnostics, combining textual NLG outputs with visual representations can help ensure that evaluations are not only text-centric but also consider the broader clinical context [17]. This multidimensional approach can help identify and mitigate biases that might be overlooked when focusing exclusively on textual outputs.

Finally, addressing bias and ensuring fairness in NLG evaluation requires a continuous and iterative process of improvement. It involves not only developing better evaluation methods but also fostering a culture of transparency, accountability, and ethical responsibility among researchers and practitioners. Initiatives such as the STAGER checklist, which provides standardized guidelines for assessing the reliability of generative AI systems, underscore the importance of systematic and ongoing efforts to enhance fairness in NLG evaluations [49]. By adopting such frameworks and continuously refining evaluation practices, the field can make significant strides in creating more equitable and trustworthy NLG systems.
### Case Studies and Applications

#### *Medical Diagnosis Support*
In the domain of medical diagnosis support, Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems have shown significant potential in enhancing the accuracy, speed, and comprehensibility of diagnostic reports. These systems can process vast amounts of clinical data, such as patient histories, test results, and imaging scans, to generate coherent and contextually relevant summaries that aid clinicians in making informed decisions [8]. One notable application involves the use of large language models like GPT-4 to assist in diagnosing complex medical conditions based on case studies similar to those found in the USMLE (United States Medical Licensing Examination). Such models can be trained on extensive datasets to understand the nuances of medical language and generate comprehensive reports that reflect the diagnostic reasoning process [8].

The integration of NLG systems into medical diagnosis workflows often involves leveraging automated evaluation metrics to ensure the quality and reliability of generated reports. For instance, automated metrics based on linguistic features can assess the grammatical correctness and coherence of the generated text, while semantic similarity metrics can evaluate how closely the system-generated report aligns with human-written gold standards [25]. Additionally, statistical and information-theoretic metrics can provide insights into the informativeness and novelty of the generated content, ensuring that the reports are both comprehensive and unique in their presentation of diagnostic findings [25].

In the context of medical diagnosis, NLG systems can also benefit from hybrid evaluation approaches that combine automated and human assessments. This dual approach allows for a more nuanced evaluation of the generated reports, taking into account both technical aspects and subjective judgments from healthcare professionals [52]. For example, automated metrics might capture the precision and recall of diagnostic information, whereas human evaluations can assess the clarity, relevance, and overall readability of the reports [52]. Furthermore, expert reviews and annotations can help identify any biases or inaccuracies in the generated content, ensuring that the final reports meet high standards of clinical suitability and trustworthiness [32].

One compelling case study involves the application of ChatGPT in unlocking the potential of medical imaging diagnostics [18]. By integrating advanced natural language processing capabilities with sophisticated image analysis algorithms, ChatGPT can generate detailed reports that interpret radiological images, such as X-rays, MRIs, and CT scans. These reports not only summarize key findings but also provide context-specific recommendations for further diagnostic actions or treatment plans [18]. This capability is particularly valuable in scenarios where rapid and accurate interpretation of imaging data is critical, such as in emergency departments or during telemedicine consultations.

Moreover, the effectiveness of NLG systems in medical diagnosis support is further enhanced by their ability to handle out-of-distribution data, which refers to cases that fall outside the typical range of the training dataset [49]. This is crucial in medicine, where patients may present with rare or unusual symptoms that require specialized diagnostic expertise. By employing robust evaluation frameworks that consider the generalizability and adaptability of the system, researchers can ensure that NLG models remain effective even when confronted with novel or unexpected clinical scenarios [49]. For instance, the STAGER checklist provides standardized guidelines for testing the reliability of generative AI systems across various domains, including medical diagnosis, thereby facilitating more rigorous and consistent evaluations [49].

In summary, the application of NLG systems in medical diagnosis support showcases their versatility and potential to transform clinical practice. Through the integration of advanced evaluation techniques, these systems can generate high-quality diagnostic reports that enhance the efficiency and accuracy of healthcare delivery. However, ongoing challenges related to fairness, bias mitigation, and scalability must be addressed to fully realize the benefits of NLG in this critical domain [52]. Future research should focus on developing more robust automated metrics, integrating multimodal evaluation techniques, and enhancing human-automated hybrid methods to ensure that NLG systems continue to improve in their diagnostic capabilities and clinical utility.
#### *Automated Report Generation*
Automated report generation stands as one of the most prominent applications of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, offering significant benefits across various domains such as healthcare, finance, and business intelligence. These systems can process large volumes of data and generate comprehensive reports that summarize key findings, trends, and insights, thereby reducing the workload of human analysts and ensuring consistency in reporting practices. In healthcare, for instance, automated report generation can streamline the documentation process for medical practitioners, providing them with detailed summaries of patient data, diagnostic results, and treatment recommendations.

One notable application of NLG in automated report generation is seen in the field of radiology, where systems like those described in [18] and [22] leverage advanced models such as ChatGPT and GPT-4V to interpret medical imaging data and generate detailed diagnostic reports. These systems not only enhance the efficiency of radiologists but also improve the accuracy and comprehensibility of reports, which can be crucial for making informed clinical decisions. The integration of multimodal capabilities in these models allows them to analyze both textual and visual data, thereby providing a more holistic view of patient conditions.

In the financial sector, automated report generation plays a pivotal role in summarizing complex financial data into actionable insights. Financial institutions use NLG systems to generate quarterly earnings reports, market analysis reports, and risk assessments. For example, systems developed by financial analysts can automatically generate reports based on real-time stock market data, economic indicators, and company-specific metrics. These reports are often used by investors and financial advisors to make strategic investment decisions. The ability of NLG systems to handle vast amounts of data and generate coherent narratives ensures that stakeholders receive timely and accurate information.

However, the development and evaluation of NLG systems for automated report generation face several challenges. One major issue is ensuring the reliability and consistency of generated reports. Human evaluators play a critical role in assessing the quality of these reports, but their judgments can be subjective and variable. As noted in [52], the proposed S.C.O.R.E. framework emphasizes the importance of evaluating large language models based on criteria such as safety, consensus, objectivity, reproducibility, and explainability. Applying similar standards to NLG systems used in automated report generation can help ensure that the generated reports meet high-quality standards and are reliable for decision-making processes.

Another challenge lies in the handling of out-of-distribution data, where the system encounters data patterns that differ significantly from the training dataset. This scenario is particularly relevant in dynamic environments such as financial markets, where new trends and anomalies can emerge rapidly. Systems must be robust enough to handle unexpected inputs without compromising the integrity of the generated reports. To address this, researchers have explored the use of adaptive hybrid approaches that combine automated metrics with human evaluations to provide a more comprehensive assessment of the system's performance. For instance, the work in [49] introduces a standardized testing and assessment guideline (STAGER checklist) aimed at evaluating the reliability of generative AI systems, which could be adapted for use in NLG systems designed for automated report generation.

Furthermore, ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in NLG systems is another critical concern. Biases can arise from the training data itself or from the algorithms used to generate text. For example, if a financial report generator is trained primarily on historical data from a particular region or industry, it might inadvertently perpetuate biases present in that data. Therefore, it is essential to incorporate diverse datasets during the training phase and to continuously monitor and adjust the system to avoid reinforcing existing biases. Additionally, incorporating feedback mechanisms that allow users to flag biased or inaccurate reports can help in refining the system over time.

In conclusion, automated report generation represents a powerful application of NLG systems, offering substantial benefits in terms of efficiency, accuracy, and consistency. However, the successful deployment of these systems requires addressing several challenges, including ensuring reliability, handling out-of-distribution data, and mitigating bias. By adopting rigorous evaluation frameworks and integrating feedback from both automated and human assessments, developers can enhance the performance and trustworthiness of NLG systems used in automated report generation, ultimately contributing to more informed decision-making across various industries.

One of the primary challenges in developing effective customer service chatbots lies in accurately assessing their performance. Traditional evaluation metrics often fall short when it comes to capturing the nuances of human-like conversation. For instance, while automated metrics such as BLEU (Bilingual Evaluation Understudy) and ROUGE (Recall-Oriented Understudy for Gisting Evaluation) are commonly used to evaluate text generation tasks, they may not adequately measure the coherence, relevance, and naturalness of chatbot responses [25]. BLEU, for example, relies heavily on n-gram overlap between generated text and human references, which might not reflect the semantic similarity or contextual appropriateness of the responses. Similarly, ROUGE focuses on recall and precision metrics but does not account for the fluency or grammatical correctness of the generated text.

To address these limitations, researchers have proposed a variety of task-specific metrics tailored for evaluating customer service chatbots. One such metric is the Consistency and Relevance Score (CRS), which evaluates the consistency of chatbot responses across multiple interactions and their relevance to the customerâ€™s query [52]. Another metric is the Customer Satisfaction Score (CSS), which combines subjective assessments from users regarding the helpfulness, accuracy, and speed of responses. These metrics aim to capture the multifaceted nature of customer interactions, ensuring that chatbots not only generate technically correct responses but also provide a satisfying user experience.

Moreover, hybrid evaluation approaches have proven particularly effective in assessing the performance of customer service chatbots. By integrating both automated and human evaluations, these methods offer a comprehensive assessment framework that leverages the strengths of each approach.

This dual-layer evaluation ensures that chatbots meet high standards of performance across various dimensions, from technical accuracy to conversational fluency.

In practice, the implementation of advanced evaluation techniques has led to significant improvements in the functionality and reliability of customer service chatbots. For instance, a study conducted by Salmonn Talebi et al. [32] assessed the performance of large language models like GPT-3.5 in generating customer service responses. The study utilized a combination of automated metrics and expert reviews to evaluate the modelsâ€™ ability to handle diverse customer queries effectively. Results indicated that while these models exhibited impressive capabilities in generating coherent and contextually appropriate responses, there were still areas where human intervention was necessary to ensure optimal performance.

Another notable case involves the use of customer service chatbots in the medical domain, where the accuracy and reliability of responses can have significant implications for patient care. Ayyub Alzahem et al. [18] explored the potential of using ChatGPT for intelligent diagnostics in medical imaging. Their research highlighted the importance of rigorous evaluation frameworks in ensuring that chatbots provide accurate and actionable insights to healthcare professionals. The study employed a multi-faceted evaluation approach, combining automated metrics for assessing response accuracy with human expert reviews to gauge the comprehensibility and clinical suitability of the generated content. The findings underscored the need for continuous evaluation and refinement of chatbot systems to align with the evolving needs of the healthcare sector.

Overall, the development and deployment of customer service chatbots necessitate a robust evaluation strategy that encompasses both quantitative and qualitative metrics. By adopting a hybrid evaluation approach and continuously refining evaluation techniques, developers can ensure that chatbots deliver high-quality, contextually relevant, and user-friendly interactions. As NLG technologies continue to advance, the importance of effective evaluation methods will only grow, driving innovation and improving the overall effectiveness of customer service chatbots in various industries.

Therefore, it is essential to employ robust evaluation metrics that can accurately assess the quality and correctness of the generated financial narratives. Automated metrics based on linguistic features, semantic similarity, and statistical analysis can be utilized to evaluate the grammatical correctness and coherence of the generated texts. Additionally, metrics focused on task-specific evaluations can be employed to ensure that the generated narratives accurately reflect the underlying financial data and provide meaningful insights.

Another challenge lies in the subjective nature of financial analysis, where different analysts might interpret the same set of financial data differently. This subjectivity can introduce variability in the evaluation of NLG-generated financial narratives. To address this issue, hybrid evaluation approaches combining automated and human assessments can be adopted. For instance, automated metrics can initially screen the generated narratives for basic grammatical and factual accuracy, while human evaluators can provide subjective judgments on the narrativeâ€™s clarity, relevance, and interpretability. This dual approach helps in achieving a balanced evaluation that considers both objective and subjective aspects of the generated texts.

Furthermore, the scalability of NLG systems in handling large volumes of financial data is another critical consideration. As companies deal with increasingly complex and voluminous financial datasets, NLG systems must be capable of efficiently processing and generating narratives for extensive financial reports. Evaluating the scalability of these systems requires metrics that measure their performance in terms of speed, resource utilization, and output quality when dealing with large datasets. Additionally, the ability of NLG systems to handle out-of-distribution dataâ€”such as new types of financial instruments or emerging financial trendsâ€”is crucial for maintaining their relevance and utility in dynamic financial markets.

### Future Directions

#### Development of More Robust Automated Metrics
In the rapidly evolving field of Natural Language Generation (NLG), the development of robust automated metrics stands as a critical frontier for advancing the evaluation of NLG systems. Current automated metrics often fall short in capturing the nuanced aspects of language generation, such as coherence, fluency, and semantic richness, which are essential for practical applications. To address these limitations, researchers have begun exploring new avenues for enhancing automated metrics through the integration of advanced computational techniques, such as deep learning models and multimodal information processing.

One promising direction involves leveraging deep learning architectures to develop more sophisticated metrics capable of evaluating NLG outputs more comprehensively. Deep learning models, particularly those based on transformer architectures, have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding complex linguistic structures and semantic relationships. By training these models on large datasets annotated with human judgments, it becomes possible to create metrics that can predict human ratings with higher accuracy. For instance, recent studies have shown that pre-trained language models, such as BERT and T5, can be fine-tuned to generate scores that closely align with human evaluations [1]. This approach not only enhances the reliability of automated metrics but also reduces the dependency on manually crafted rules, which are often limited in their scope and effectiveness.

Another key aspect of developing more robust automated metrics lies in integrating multimodal information into the evaluation process. Traditional NLG evaluation metrics primarily focus on textual output, overlooking the importance of visual and auditory cues that can significantly influence the quality and impact of generated content. By incorporating multimodal data, such as images, videos, and audio recordings, into the evaluation framework, researchers can assess how well NLG systems generate coherent narratives that integrate multiple forms of media. This multi-faceted approach is particularly relevant in domains like multimedia journalism, where the ability to synthesize text and visuals effectively is crucial. Moreover, multimodal evaluation can help in identifying and mitigating biases that might arise from relying solely on textual data [2].

Furthermore, the development of more robust automated metrics requires addressing the challenges associated with out-of-distribution (OOD) data. OOD data refers to inputs that differ significantly from the training distribution, posing significant difficulties for existing evaluation metrics. These metrics often fail to accurately assess the performance of NLG systems when confronted with unseen scenarios or contexts, leading to misleading conclusions about system capabilities. To overcome this issue, researchers are investigating methods to enhance the generalizability of automated metrics through the use of synthetic data and adversarial training techniques. For example, synthetic data generation can be employed to create diverse and challenging test cases that reflect real-world variability, thereby improving the robustness of evaluation metrics. Additionally, adversarial training involves exposing the evaluation model to deliberately crafted inputs designed to challenge its assumptions and boundaries, forcing it to adapt and improve its performance across a wider range of scenarios [3].

In parallel with technical advancements, there is a growing emphasis on ensuring fairness and transparency in the development and application of automated metrics. As NLG systems become increasingly prevalent in sensitive domains such as healthcare and finance, the need for unbiased and reliable evaluation metrics becomes paramount. To achieve this, researchers are advocating for the inclusion of explicit fairness criteria during the design and validation phases of automated metrics. This includes considering demographic factors, cultural context, and ethical implications to prevent discriminatory outcomes. Furthermore, transparent reporting of metric performance across different user groups and scenarios can foster greater trust and acceptance among stakeholders [4].

In conclusion, the development of more robust automated metrics represents a vital step towards achieving comprehensive and reliable evaluation of NLG systems. By harnessing the power of deep learning, integrating multimodal information, addressing OOD data challenges, and prioritizing fairness and transparency, researchers can pave the way for a new generation of evaluation tools that better serve the diverse needs of the NLG community. These advancements not only promise to enhance the scientific rigor of NLG research but also contribute to the broader goal of creating NLG systems that are trustworthy, effective, and ethically sound in real-world applications.

#### Integration of Multimodal Evaluation Techniques
The integration of multimodal evaluation techniques represents a promising avenue for advancing the field of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. As NLG applications increasingly incorporate visual, auditory, and other sensory data alongside textual output, there is a growing need for comprehensive evaluation frameworks that can assess the performance of these systems across multiple modalities. Traditional evaluation metrics, which often focus solely on linguistic aspects of NLG outputs, may fall short in capturing the holistic effectiveness of multimodal systems. Therefore, developing multimodal evaluation techniques is crucial for ensuring that NLG systems meet the diverse requirements of real-world applications.

One approach to integrating multimodal evaluation involves leveraging cross-modal alignment methods. These methods aim to ensure that the generated text aligns coherently with accompanying visual or auditory information. For instance, in the context of automated report generation, an NLG system might be tasked with describing images or videos in natural language. In such scenarios, it is essential to evaluate not only the textual quality but also the consistency between the generated text and the corresponding multimedia content. Techniques like cross-modal retrieval, where the system-generated text is used to retrieve the correct image from a set of images, can provide insights into how well the NLG system has captured the essence of the visual content [14]. Additionally, incorporating human evaluations where participants judge the coherence between text and visuals can further refine our understanding of system performance in multimodal settings.

Another aspect of multimodal evaluation is the assessment of the systemâ€™s ability to generate contextually appropriate responses based on multimodal inputs. This is particularly relevant in applications like customer service chatbots, where the system might receive both text-based queries and accompanying images or audio recordings. To evaluate such systems effectively, one could employ task-specific metrics that measure the systemâ€™s performance in generating accurate and contextually relevant responses. For example, in medical diagnosis support systems, an NLG component might analyze patient descriptions along with diagnostic images to produce coherent and informative reports. Here, the evaluation would not only consider the textual quality but also the accuracy of the generated report in relation to the provided multimodal input [33].

Furthermore, the development of multimodal evaluation techniques should account for the unique challenges posed by different application domains. Each domain may have specific requirements and constraints that necessitate tailored evaluation strategies. For instance, in educational content creation, the NLG system might generate text accompanied by interactive visual aids or animations. Evaluating such systems requires considering not just the textual quality but also the pedagogical effectiveness of the multimodal content. Metrics could include assessments of student engagement, comprehension levels, and overall learning outcomes [9]. Similarly, in financial statement analysis, the system might generate textual summaries alongside graphical representations of financial data. Here, the evaluation would focus on the accuracy of the generated text in relation to the provided charts and graphs, as well as the clarity and interpretability of the multimodal presentation [48].

Moreover, the integration of multimodal evaluation techniques can benefit from advancements in machine learning and artificial intelligence. Recent developments in deep learning models capable of processing multiple modalities simultaneously offer new opportunities for evaluating NLG systems. For example, models that can jointly process text and images can be used to generate more sophisticated evaluation metrics that capture the interplay between different modalities. Such models could help identify subtle inconsistencies or mismatches between text and visuals that might be missed by traditional unimodal evaluation methods [23]. Additionally, the use of synthetic data, which allows for controlled experimentation with various multimodal configurations, can enhance the robustness of evaluation processes. By creating datasets that simulate real-world multimodal scenarios, researchers can test and validate their evaluation metrics under diverse conditions, thereby improving the reliability and generalizability of the results [14].

In conclusion, the integration of multimodal evaluation techniques holds significant promise for enhancing the evaluation of NLG systems. By accounting for the interplay between different modalities, these techniques can provide a more comprehensive and nuanced assessment of system performance. However, realizing this potential requires addressing several challenges, such as developing task-specific metrics, ensuring consistency across different modalities, and adapting evaluation methods to the unique demands of various application domains. Through continued research and innovation in this area, we can pave the way for more effective and reliable NLG systems that meet the multifaceted needs of modern computing environments.

To mitigate these issues, researchers could develop standardized guidelines and training programs for evaluators to ensure consistent assessments across different contexts and domains. Additionally, incorporating expert reviews and annotations, as discussed in [23], can help identify and correct potential biases in human judgments. By leveraging the insights from experts, the reliability of human evaluations can be significantly enhanced, leading to more accurate and trustworthy hybrid assessments.

Another key aspect of enhancing hybrid methods lies in the development of more sophisticated automated metrics that can complement human evaluations effectively. Automated metrics based on linguistic features, semantic similarity, and statistical measures have been widely used but often fall short in capturing the full range of NLG quality attributes [4]. Future research should aim to create composite metrics that integrate multiple dimensions of NLG output quality, such as coherence, relevance, and fluency, into a single, unified framework. Such composite metrics would not only provide a more holistic view of system performance but also enable better alignment between human and automated evaluations. Moreover, incorporating machine learning techniques to automatically learn and refine evaluation criteria from large datasets could further enhance the precision and adaptability of automated metrics [16].

The challenge of integrating automated and human evaluations seamlessly is another critical area for improvement. Current hybrid approaches often involve manual selection and combination of different metrics, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Future work should explore adaptive hybrid methods that can dynamically adjust the weight and importance of different metrics based on contextual factors and specific application requirements. For instance, in scenarios where user satisfaction is paramount, the weight given to subjective human feedback might be higher compared to objective automated scores. Similarly, in technical domains requiring high accuracy, automated metrics focused on precision and correctness could be prioritized. Developing algorithms capable of learning optimal combinations of metrics through machine learning techniques could greatly enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of hybrid evaluations [14].

Furthermore, ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in hybrid evaluations is essential for the broader adoption and trustworthiness of NLG systems. Both human and automated evaluations can inadvertently introduce biases, either through evaluator prejudices or algorithmic biases in data-driven models. Addressing these issues requires a multi-faceted approach, including the development of fairness-aware metrics and evaluation protocols. Researchers should investigate how to design evaluation frameworks that account for demographic and cultural diversity, ensuring that NLG systems perform well across different user groups. Additionally, incorporating bias detection mechanisms in automated metrics, as suggested in [23], can help identify and mitigate potential biases in system outputs. By systematically addressing fairness concerns, hybrid evaluation methods can become more robust and reliable tools for assessing NLG systems.

In conclusion, enhancing human-automated hybrid methods for evaluating NLG systems involves a concerted effort to improve the reliability of human evaluations, develop advanced automated metrics, optimize integration strategies, and address fairness and bias mitigation. These advancements are crucial for advancing the field of NLG and ensuring that evaluation methods accurately reflect the complex nature of NLG outputs. As NLG applications continue to expand into diverse domains such as healthcare, education, and finance, the need for comprehensive and unbiased evaluation techniques becomes increasingly important. By focusing on these areas of future research, we can pave the way for more effective and trustworthy NLG systems that meet the evolving needs of users and society.

Addressing bias and fairness in evaluation is a critical future direction for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems. As NLG technologies become increasingly integrated into various applications ranging from medical diagnosis support to financial statement analysis, the potential for biased outcomes poses significant ethical and practical challenges. Biased evaluations can lead to unfair treatment of certain groups, exacerbate existing societal inequalities, and undermine the trust in these systems. Therefore, developing robust methodologies to mitigate bias and ensure fairness in NLG evaluation is essential.

One approach to addressing bias involves the careful selection and design of evaluation datasets. Current datasets often reflect historical biases and may not adequately represent diverse populations, leading to skewed evaluation results. For instance, a dataset predominantly composed of texts written by individuals from a specific demographic group might unfairly disadvantage models trained on more diverse data. To combat this, researchers are advocating for the creation of more inclusive and representative datasets that encompass a wide range of linguistic styles, cultural contexts, and socio-economic backgrounds [33]. Additionally, incorporating synthetic test data that simulates real-world scenarios but controls for known biases can help in identifying and mitigating potential issues before they manifest in actual deployments [14].

Another key aspect of ensuring fairness in NLG evaluation involves the development of metrics that explicitly account for bias. Traditional quantitative metrics, such as BLEU or ROUGE scores, focus primarily on surface-level features like lexical overlap and syntactic structure, which may inadvertently overlook deeper semantic and contextual differences. Novel metrics that incorporate bias-aware components, such as those designed to detect and penalize gender, racial, or socioeconomic biases, could provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance [23]. These metrics would require careful calibration to balance the trade-off between accuracy and fairness, ensuring that models are not overly penalized for non-biased variations in language use.

Moreover, human-in-the-loop evaluation methods offer a promising avenue for addressing bias in NLG systems. While automated metrics can efficiently assess large volumes of text, they lack the nuanced understanding of context and social norms that humans possess. Integrating human evaluators who are trained to recognize and report instances of bias can significantly enhance the reliability and fairness of evaluation processes. However, this approach also introduces challenges related to consistency and scalability. Ensuring that human evaluators are well-trained and consistently apply evaluation criteria across different contexts and domains is crucial. Furthermore, leveraging techniques from crowdsourcing and participatory evaluation can help in scaling up human assessments while maintaining quality standards [53].

The integration of multimodal evaluation techniques represents another frontier in addressing bias and fairness. NLG systems often interact within complex multimodal environments where textual outputs are accompanied by visual, auditory, or haptic cues. Metrics that consider the interplay between these modalities can provide a more holistic view of system performance and help identify potential sources of bias that may be overlooked when focusing solely on text. For example, evaluating the alignment between generated text and accompanying images can reveal whether certain demographic groups are disproportionately represented or stereotyped [49]. Developing composite metrics that combine insights from multiple modalities can thus contribute to more equitable and reliable NLG evaluations.

Finally, fostering transparency and accountability in the evaluation process is fundamental to addressing bias and promoting fairness. Transparent reporting of evaluation methodologies, datasets, and results enables researchers and practitioners to critically assess the validity and fairness of their findings. Initiatives such as the STAGER checklist, which provides standardized guidelines for testing and assessing generative AI reliability, underscore the importance of rigorous and transparent evaluation practices [49]. Moreover, establishing community-driven standards and best practices for bias mitigation in NLG evaluation can facilitate broader adoption of fair and unbiased evaluation methodologies across the field.

In conclusion, addressing bias and fairness in NLG evaluation requires a multifaceted approach that encompasses the development of inclusive datasets, the creation of bias-aware metrics, the integration of human-in-the-loop evaluation methods, the exploration of multimodal evaluation techniques, and the promotion of transparency and accountability. By adopting these strategies, the NLG community can move towards more equitable and trustworthy evaluation practices, ultimately enhancing the reliability and fairness of NLG systems in real-world applications.

To address this, researchers should develop hybrid evaluation approaches that combine automated metrics with human assessments to better gauge the effectiveness of chatbot interactions. For example, metrics focused on semantic similarity and contextual understanding could be integrated with subjective evaluations based on user feedback and satisfaction scores. Additionally, incorporating temporal metrics that track the evolution of conversation over time could help identify areas for improvement in maintaining coherence and relevance throughout the dialogue.

In the educational sector, NLG systems have the potential to revolutionize content creation and personalization. However, evaluating the efficacy of these systems requires metrics that go beyond simple readability and grammar checks. Future research should explore composite metrics that assess the pedagogical value and engagement level of generated educational materials. This could involve integrating task-specific evaluations that consider factors such as alignment with learning objectives, adaptability to different student needs, and the ability to foster interactive and engaging learning experiences. Furthermore, the development of multimodal evaluation techniques that incorporate visual and auditory elements alongside textual output could enhance the overall assessment of educational NLG systems.

Finally, the expansion of NLG into financial statement analysis highlights the need for robust evaluation frameworks that can handle complex data-driven narratives. Financial reports often contain intricate details and require a deep understanding of market trends and economic indicators. Current metrics may not be sufficient to evaluate the accuracy and reliability of NLG-generated financial analyses. Future work should focus on creating metrics that can effectively assess the financial literacy and analytical depth of generated statements. This could involve leveraging statistical and information-theoretic metrics to evaluate the precision and consistency of data representation, alongside qualitative assessments based on expert reviews and annotations. Moreover, addressing scalability issues in the evaluation process will be crucial, especially as the volume of financial data continues to grow exponentially.

In conclusion, the expansion of NLG into diverse application domains necessitates the development of tailored evaluation metrics that can accurately assess system performance in specific contexts. By focusing on specialized metrics and hybrid evaluation approaches, researchers can ensure that NLG systems meet the unique requirements of each domain, ultimately enhancing their utility and reliability in real-world applications.
### Conclusion

#### Summary of Key Findings
In summarizing the key findings from this comprehensive survey on evaluation metrics used for Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, it becomes evident that the field has evolved significantly over the years, driven by both technological advancements and the increasing complexity of applications. One of the primary insights gleaned from our review is the multifaceted nature of NLG evaluation, which necessitates a diverse array of metrics to capture different aspects of system performance. These metrics can broadly be categorized into quantitative, qualitative, task-specific, composite, and temporal/contextual types, each serving unique purposes and providing distinct perspectives on system effectiveness [4].

Quantitative metrics, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, have long been staples in NLG evaluation, offering straightforward numerical assessments of text quality based on n-gram overlap between generated and reference texts [7]. However, their reliance on statistical similarity measures often fails to capture nuances in meaning and coherence, leading to the development of more sophisticated semantic similarity metrics like BERTScore and BLEURT, which leverage deep learning models to better align with human judgments [25]. Meanwhile, qualitative metrics, while subjective and less objective, provide invaluable insights into how well NLG outputs meet specific communicative goals and adhere to stylistic conventions, making them indispensable for evaluating systems in contextually rich environments [33].

Task-specific metrics further refine the evaluation process by tailoring assessment criteria to the particularities of different NLG tasks, ensuring that evaluations are not only comprehensive but also relevant to real-world applications. For instance, in medical diagnosis support systems, metrics might prioritize accuracy and clarity over creativity, whereas in educational content creation, emphasis could shift towards engagement and pedagogical value [48]. Composite metrics, which integrate multiple dimensions of performance, offer a more holistic view of system capabilities, although they come with the challenge of balancing competing objectives and ensuring that no aspect of performance is unduly emphasized [49].

The integration of automated and human evaluations represents another significant trend in NLG assessment, reflecting a growing recognition of the strengths and limitations inherent in each approach. Automated metrics, while efficient and scalable, often struggle with capturing the subtleties of human perception and understanding, leading to scenarios where high scores on automated tests do not necessarily translate to satisfactory performance in practical settings [54]. Conversely, human evaluations, though more nuanced and reflective of actual user experiences, are time-consuming and prone to variability across evaluators. Hybrid approaches aim to leverage the best of both worlds by combining automated precision with human insight, thereby providing a more balanced and reliable assessment framework [27].

Despite these advancements, several challenges persist in the realm of NLG evaluation. Subjectivity remains a pervasive issue, particularly in qualitative and human-driven assessments, complicating efforts to achieve consistency and reliability across different evaluators and contexts [39]. Moreover, the variability of performance across different domains highlights the need for domain-specific metrics and evaluation protocols, as what constitutes effective NLG output can vary significantly depending on the application area [14]. Scalability issues pose another hurdle, especially when dealing with large-scale datasets or real-time applications, where manual evaluation is impractical, and automated methods must step up to meet demands for efficiency without sacrificing quality [18].

Additionally, the handling of out-of-distribution data presents a critical challenge, as many current evaluation frameworks are optimized for in-distribution scenarios and may fail to adequately assess system robustness and generalizability in novel or unexpected situations [3]. Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in NLG evaluations is also paramount, given the potential for these systems to perpetuate or exacerbate existing societal biases if not carefully monitored and controlled [4]. Lastly, the rapid pace of technological progress underscores the need for continuous refinement and adaptation of evaluation techniques to keep pace with evolving NLG capabilities and applications.

In conclusion, while substantial progress has been made in developing and refining evaluation metrics for NLG systems, there remains much room for improvement and innovation. The integration of multimodal evaluation techniques, enhancement of hybrid human-automated methods, and addressing issues of bias and fairness represent key areas for future research and development. As the field continues to expand into new domains and applications, the quest for robust, reliable, and comprehensive evaluation methodologies will remain a central concern, driving ongoing advancements in NLG technology and its practical utility.
#### Implications for Future Research
In conclusion, the implications for future research in the evaluation of NLG systems are vast and multifaceted, driven by the rapid advancements in natural language processing and the increasing complexity of NLG applications. One of the primary areas that warrant further investigation is the development of more robust automated metrics. Currently, many automated evaluation metrics, such as BLEU, ROUGE, and METEOR, rely heavily on surface-level linguistic features and statistical measures, which often fail to capture the deeper semantic and pragmatic aspects of language generation [4]. As NLG systems continue to evolve, there is a pressing need to develop metrics that can better assess the quality and effectiveness of generated text across various domains and contexts.

The integration of multimodal evaluation techniques represents another promising avenue for future research. With the advent of multimodal data sources, such as images, videos, and audio, NLG systems are increasingly required to generate text that is coherent and contextually relevant with respect to multiple modalities [7]. This necessitates the development of evaluation metrics that can account for the interplay between different modalities and the generated text. For instance, metrics that can evaluate the alignment between visual and textual information in image captioning tasks or the synchronization between spoken words and gestures in conversational agents would be invaluable in assessing the performance of multimodal NLG systems [49].

Moreover, enhancing human-automated hybrid methods is crucial for achieving comprehensive and reliable evaluations of NLG systems. While automated metrics offer efficiency and scalability, they often fall short in capturing the nuanced aspects of language that are best assessed through human judgment. Conversely, human evaluations, while subjective and resource-intensive, provide valuable insights into the quality and usability of generated text [27]. Future research should focus on developing adaptive hybrid approaches that can dynamically integrate automated and human evaluations based on the specific requirements and constraints of different NLG applications. For example, systems that can automatically flag potential issues in generated text for human review or those that can use machine learning algorithms to predict when human input is most necessary could significantly enhance the reliability and comprehensiveness of evaluations [25].

Addressing bias and ensuring fairness in NLG evaluation is also a critical area for future research. Many existing evaluation metrics have been shown to exhibit biases that can unfairly penalize certain types of text or favor others [54]. For instance, metrics that rely on pre-defined reference texts may inadvertently privilege certain styles or genres of writing over others, thereby skewing the evaluation results. Future work should aim to develop metrics that are more equitable and representative, taking into account factors such as cultural diversity, linguistic variability, and social context [33]. Additionally, researchers should explore ways to mitigate biases in both automated and human evaluations, such as by using diverse sets of evaluators or by incorporating fairness-aware algorithms into automated metrics [4].

Finally, expanding the application domains for NLG evaluation is essential for ensuring that these systems meet the diverse needs of various industries and user groups. While current research has primarily focused on evaluating NLG systems in fields such as healthcare, finance, and education, there is a growing demand for NLG solutions in areas such as legal services, journalism, and public policy [48]. Future research should address the unique challenges and requirements of these emerging domains, developing specialized evaluation metrics and methodologies that can effectively assess the performance and impact of NLG systems in new and evolving contexts. By doing so, researchers can help ensure that NLG technologies are not only technically advanced but also socially responsible and ethically sound.

In summary, the field of NLG evaluation is poised for significant advancements, driven by ongoing research and technological innovations. The development of more robust automated metrics, the integration of multimodal evaluation techniques, the enhancement of human-automated hybrid methods, the mitigation of bias and fairness issues, and the expansion of application domains all represent key areas for future exploration. These efforts will not only improve the accuracy and reliability of NLG system evaluations but also contribute to the broader goal of creating NLG technologies that are effective, ethical, and beneficial for society at large.
#### Recommendations for Practitioners
In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, practitioners face the ongoing challenge of selecting and implementing effective evaluation metrics that accurately reflect the performance and quality of their models. As highlighted throughout this survey, no single metric can provide a comprehensive assessment of NLG systems due to the inherent complexity and multifaceted nature of language generation tasks. Therefore, it is imperative for practitioners to adopt a multi-faceted approach to evaluation that leverages both automated and human-assessed metrics tailored to the specific context and application domain of their NLG system.

Firstly, practitioners should prioritize the use of composite metrics that integrate multiple dimensions of NLG performance, such as linguistic accuracy, semantic coherence, and task-specific effectiveness. These composite metrics can be constructed by combining quantitative measures like BLEU scores and ROUGE scores with qualitative assessments based on human evaluations [4]. Such an integrated approach not only provides a more holistic view of the system's capabilities but also helps in identifying specific areas for improvement. For instance, if a system performs well on automated linguistic accuracy metrics but poorly on human-rated coherence, this discrepancy can guide further refinement efforts towards enhancing the system's ability to generate coherent narratives.

Secondly, given the subjective nature of human judgments and the variability across different domains, practitioners should consider employing standardized testing frameworks and guidelines, such as the STAGER checklist [49], which offer structured methodologies for evaluating generative AI reliability. These frameworks can help mitigate issues related to inconsistency and bias in human evaluations by providing clear criteria and procedures for conducting assessments. Additionally, utilizing large-scale datasets and diverse user populations can enhance the robustness and generalizability of human evaluation results, ensuring that the system's performance is assessed under realistic conditions and across various contexts.

Moreover, the integration of multimodal evaluation techniques represents another promising direction for improving the evaluation of NLG systems. As NLG applications increasingly incorporate visual, auditory, and other sensory inputs alongside textual outputs, metrics that account for the interplay between different modalities become crucial. For example, in scenarios where NLG systems are used to generate captions for images or videos, evaluation metrics should not only assess the textual quality but also how effectively the generated text aligns with and enhances the understanding of the multimedia content [14]. This holistic evaluation approach can lead to more sophisticated and context-aware NLG systems that better meet the needs of end-users.

Finally, addressing fairness and bias in NLG evaluation is essential for ensuring that these systems do not perpetuate or exacerbate existing societal inequalities. Practitioners must be vigilant in identifying and mitigating biases that may arise from the training data, evaluation datasets, or even the evaluation metrics themselves. This involves adopting best practices such as using diverse and representative datasets, incorporating fairness-aware metrics during evaluation, and continuously monitoring the systemâ€™s performance across different demographic groups [54]. Furthermore, engaging with interdisciplinary experts and stakeholders from diverse backgrounds can provide valuable insights and perspectives that help in developing more equitable and inclusive NLG systems.

In summary, the recommendations for practitioners emphasize the importance of adopting a comprehensive and adaptive evaluation strategy that combines automated and human-assessed metrics, employs standardized testing frameworks, integrates multimodal evaluation techniques, and prioritizes fairness and inclusivity. By adhering to these guidelines, practitioners can ensure that their NLG systems are rigorously evaluated and continuously improved, ultimately leading to more reliable, effective, and ethically sound applications in various domains.
#### Limitations of Existing Evaluation Methods
In the realm of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, the evaluation of performance and quality remains a complex and multifaceted challenge. Despite significant advancements in automated and human-based evaluation metrics, several limitations persist that hinder the comprehensive assessment of NLG systems. One of the primary challenges lies in the inherent subjectivity of human evaluations, which can introduce variability and inconsistency across different assessors [4]. This subjectivity is further exacerbated by the context-dependent nature of language, where the same output might be perceived differently based on the evaluator's background, expertise, and cultural context.

Another critical limitation is the scalability issue associated with large-scale evaluations. While human assessments provide valuable insights into the qualitative aspects of NLG outputs, they become impractical when dealing with vast datasets or real-time applications [7]. Automated metrics, although scalable, often fall short in capturing the nuanced aspects of language generation, such as creativity, coherence, and context-awareness. Furthermore, the reliance on pre-defined benchmarks and test datasets can lead to overfitting issues, where models perform well on specific test cases but fail to generalize to unseen data [14].

The variability across different domains and tasks also poses significant challenges in evaluating NLG systems. Metrics that are effective in one domain, such as financial report generation, may not be suitable for others, like medical diagnosis support or educational content creation [49]. This domain-specificity necessitates the development of task-specific metrics that can accurately reflect the performance of NLG systems in diverse applications. However, creating such metrics requires a deep understanding of the specific domain requirements and constraints, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming.

Moreover, the handling of out-of-distribution (OOD) data presents another significant limitation. Many existing evaluation methods are designed based on in-distribution data, leading to biased evaluations that do not account for the modelâ€™s performance on unseen or rare scenarios [54]. This can be particularly problematic in safety-critical applications, such as medical diagnostics, where the ability to handle unexpected inputs is crucial. Ensuring that NLG systems can generate coherent and appropriate responses to OOD inputs remains an open research question.

Bias and fairness in evaluation are additional concerns that have gained increasing attention in recent years. Both automated and human-based evaluation methods can inadvertently perpetuate biases present in the training data or the evaluation process itself [27]. For instance, if the dataset used for benchmarking contains gender or racial biases, the evaluation results might unfairly favor certain groups while disadvantaging others. Addressing these biases requires careful consideration of the data collection process, the design of evaluation metrics, and the inclusion of diverse perspectives during the evaluation phase.

Furthermore, the dynamic nature of language and the rapid pace of technological advancement pose continuous challenges to the robustness and relevance of existing evaluation methods. As new NLG techniques and models emerge, the benchmarks and metrics used for evaluation must evolve accordingly to maintain their effectiveness [25]. This necessitates ongoing research and collaboration between researchers, practitioners, and domain experts to ensure that evaluation methods remain up-to-date and applicable to the latest developments in NLG.

In conclusion, while significant progress has been made in the evaluation of NLG systems, the limitations discussed above highlight the need for continued innovation and improvement. Future research should focus on developing more robust and adaptable evaluation frameworks that can address the challenges of subjectivity, scalability, domain specificity, OOD data handling, bias mitigation, and the dynamic nature of language technology. By doing so, the field can move towards more reliable and comprehensive evaluation methods that truly reflect the capabilities and limitations of NLG systems in various applications.
#### Outlook on Advancing NLG Evaluation Techniques
In the rapidly evolving landscape of Natural Language Generation (NLG) systems, the quest for robust and comprehensive evaluation techniques remains a critical frontier. As NLG technologies continue to permeate various sectors, from healthcare to finance, the need for reliable and fair assessment metrics becomes increasingly paramount. This section offers an outlook on advancing NLG evaluation techniques, highlighting potential directions that could shape future research and practice.

One promising avenue for advancement lies in the development of more sophisticated automated evaluation metrics. Current metrics often struggle to capture the nuanced aspects of human language, such as context-awareness and emotional tone. Future research could focus on integrating advanced natural language understanding capabilities into automated metrics, allowing them to better assess the quality and appropriateness of NLG outputs in specific contexts. For instance, leveraging contextual embeddings and semantic similarity measures could enhance the ability of automated metrics to evaluate the coherence and relevance of generated text [25]. Additionally, incorporating multimodal information, such as visual and auditory cues, might further enrich the evaluation process, especially for applications like educational content creation and customer service chatbots [49].

Another critical direction involves refining hybrid evaluation approaches that combine automated and human assessments. While automated metrics offer efficiency and scalability, they can fall short in capturing subjective dimensions of language quality that humans readily perceive. Conversely, human evaluations, though invaluable for their depth and nuance, are time-consuming and prone to variability. Developing adaptive hybrid methods that dynamically adjust the balance between automated and human evaluations based on task requirements and domain characteristics could yield more balanced and accurate assessments. For example, in medical diagnosis support systems, where precision and reliability are paramount, a higher reliance on human evaluations might be warranted. In contrast, for large-scale applications like financial statement analysis, where consistency across numerous documents is crucial, automated metrics could play a dominant role [27].

Ensuring fairness and mitigating bias in NLG evaluation is another pressing concern that warrants attention. Biases in training data and evaluation criteria can lead to unfair outcomes, particularly when NLG systems are deployed in sensitive domains such as healthcare and criminal justice. Future work should aim to develop and implement standardized guidelines for assessing and mitigating biases in both the generation and evaluation phases of NLG systems. This includes developing benchmarks that explicitly test for bias and fairness, similar to those proposed for other AI models [39]. Furthermore, fostering greater transparency and accountability in the evaluation processâ€”through clear reporting of evaluation methods and resultsâ€”can help build trust among stakeholders and ensure that NLG systems are ethically sound.

Expanding the application domains of NLG evaluation techniques represents yet another fertile area for future exploration. As NLG systems become more pervasive, there is a growing need to tailor evaluation methods to diverse application areas, each with its unique challenges and requirements. For instance, while existing metrics might suffice for evaluating report generation tasks, they may fall short in assessing the effectiveness of NLG systems designed for interactive dialogue or creative writing. Tailoring evaluation frameworks to specific use cases could involve developing task-specific metrics that capture the unique attributes of different NLG applications. This could include metrics focused on engagement and user satisfaction in conversational agents, or metrics that evaluate the creativity and originality of generated texts in literary applications [33].

Finally, the integration of lifelong learning and continuous improvement mechanisms into NLG evaluation processes holds significant promise. As NLG systems evolve over time, so too must the methods used to evaluate them. Lifelong benchmarks that allow for efficient and ongoing model evaluation can facilitate the iterative refinement of NLG systems, ensuring they remain up-to-date and effective in dynamic environments. Such benchmarks could incorporate synthetic test data generation techniques, enabling more thorough and representative testing without the need for extensive real-world data collection [14]. Moreover, adopting a lifecycle approach to evaluation can help identify and address emerging issues, such as the handling of out-of-distribution data and the adaptation to new contexts, thereby enhancing the resilience and adaptability of NLG systems.

In conclusion, advancing NLG evaluation techniques requires a multifaceted approach that addresses the limitations of current methods and embraces innovative solutions. By focusing on the development of more robust automated metrics, refining hybrid evaluation strategies, ensuring fairness and mitigating bias, expanding application domains, and integrating lifelong learning mechanisms, researchers and practitioners can pave the way for more reliable, ethical, and versatile NLG systems. These advancements not only promise to improve the performance and usability of NLG systems but also contribute to the broader goal of fostering trustworthy and responsible AI practices.
