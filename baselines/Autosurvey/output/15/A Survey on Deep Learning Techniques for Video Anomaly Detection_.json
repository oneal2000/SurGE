These anomalies can manifest as unexpected changes in motion, appearance, or behavior and often indicate potential threats or harmful incidents in various applications, such as surveillance, security, and monitoring [1]. The significance of video anomaly detection lies in its capability to enhance situational awareness, improve response times, and reduce the risk of harm, thereby contributing to overall safety and operational efficiency in both public and private spaces.\n\nIn modern intelligent video surveillance systems, video anomaly detection plays a crucial role by automating the identification of irregularities that signify anomalous behavior. This automation not only increases monitoring efficiency but also significantly alleviates the workload of live monitoring personnel [2]. Anomalies in video sequences can be categorized into two types: temporal localization, which involves identifying the start and end frames of the anomaly event, and spatial localization, which entails pinpointing the exact pixels within each anomaly frame corresponding to the anomaly event [2].\n\nThe importance of video anomaly detection spans multiple sectors and use cases. In public spaces like transportation hubs, shopping malls, and parks, these systems are essential for identifying potential security breaches, crowd disturbances, or emergency situations that require immediate attention [1]. For example, detecting sudden violent behavior or unattended baggage can trigger alerts for security personnel, enabling swift action to prevent potential threats. In healthcare facilities, hospitals can utilize video anomaly detection to monitor patient conditions, detect falls, or identify instances of staff neglect, thereby ensuring patient safety and well-being [1].\n\nMoreover, video anomaly detection has significant applications in industrial settings, where it can aid in monitoring machinery operations, detecting equipment failures, or identifying unsafe work practices that could lead to accidents [3]. For instance, in manufacturing plants, early detection of anomalies in machinery movements or worker actions can prevent costly downtimes and injuries. In retail environments, anomaly detection can help in preventing shoplifting, vandalism, or other criminal activities that may jeopardize store security and inventory integrity [1].\n\nBeyond these traditional domains, video anomaly detection is increasingly being explored for innovative applications. In smart cities, it can enhance traffic management by identifying abnormal traffic patterns or road conditions that demand urgent intervention [4]. Additionally, in home security systems, the ability to detect anomalies provides homeowners with real-time alerts and quick responses to potential intrusions or emergencies [5].\n\nDespite its wide-ranging benefits, the deployment of video anomaly detection systems encounters several challenges. The primary challenge is the extensive variability in anomalies across different contexts, necessitating robust and adaptable algorithms that can generalize well to unseen scenarios. Another challenge is the requirement for large volumes of annotated data to effectively train deep learning models, which can be resource-intensive and time-consuming [1]. Ensuring privacy and addressing ethical concerns associated with deploying such systems in public and private spaces are also critical considerations that require thorough planning and mitigation strategies [6].\n\nIn conclusion, video anomaly detection is a vital technology with profound implications for enhancing safety and operational efficiency across various sectors. Its ability to automate the detection of irregularities and potential threats makes it indispensable for modern surveillance and monitoring systems. By continually advancing methodologies and addressing associated challenges, video anomaly detection holds significant promise for shaping the future of intelligent security and monitoring solutions [1].\n\n### 1.2 Challenges in Traditional Methods\n\nTraditional methods of video anomaly detection face a myriad of challenges that limit their effectiveness and scalability. These challenges encompass computational inefficiency, difficulties in handling dynamic scenes, and the necessity for extensive manual intervention, each posing significant barriers to achieving accurate and reliable anomaly detection in real-world scenarios.\n\n**Computational Inefficiency**\n\nA primary challenge is the computational inefficiency of traditional methods, driven by the complexity of video data and the requirement for robust algorithms to process large volumes of visual information. Traditional techniques often rely on handcrafted features, such as Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG), which demand substantial computational resources for extracting meaningful patterns from video sequences. Additionally, the real-time demands of many applications necessitate algorithms that can process video streams promptly, thereby intensifying the computational burden.\n\nMoreover, traditional methods frequently depend on extensive offline training phases, consuming significant time and computational power. Training classifiers on large datasets with traditional machine learning methods can take hours or even days, delaying the deployment of anomaly detection systems and limiting their adaptability to evolving environments.\n\n**Difficulty in Handling Dynamic Scenes**\n\nHandling dynamic scenes is another significant challenge. Dynamic scenes are characterized by frequent changes in backgrounds, moving objects, and lighting conditions, complicating anomaly detection. Traditional methods often struggle with accurately modeling temporal dependencies and spatial relationships, resulting in reduced detection accuracy and higher false alarm rates.\n\nFor instance, traditional background subtraction techniques assume a static background and fail to adjust to gradual changes, leading to false alarms or missed anomalies. They also lack the capacity to manage the high variability in object appearances and behaviors in dynamic scenes, particularly in crowded environments, where object interactions are crucial for accurate anomaly detection.\n\n**Need for Extensive Manual Intervention**\n\nThe requirement for extensive manual intervention is another key challenge. Traditional systems rely heavily on manually labeled data for training classifiers and defining normal behavior, a process that is labor-intensive and time-consuming. Acquiring and annotating large datasets is costly and requires specialized expertise, making deployment difficult in real-world settings lacking annotated data.\n\nContinuous manual supervision and maintenance are also necessary, adding to the challenges. Environmental changes, such as new objects or layout modifications, necessitate frequent updates, which can be cumbersome and resource-intensive. The absence of automated mechanisms for adjusting system parameters based on real-time feedback further restricts adaptability to evolving conditions.\n\n**Limited Adaptability and Robustness**\n\nTraditional methods exhibit limited adaptability and robustness, critical for effective anomaly detection in real-world scenarios. Fixed models and parameters cannot easily accommodate data distribution changes, rendering them ineffective in scenarios with sudden environmental shifts. This can lead to decreased detection accuracy and increased false alarms, compromising system reliability.\n\nAdditionally, traditional methods often lack the robustness needed to handle real-world video data's inherent noise and variability, such as occlusions and motion blur. For example, traditional motion detection fails in cluttered scenes due to disruptions caused by occlusions and partial visibility, while feature extraction-based methods produce unreliable results in noisy conditions, further degrading system effectiveness.\n\n**Overfitting and Generalization Issues**\n\nOverfitting and generalization issues are additional challenges. Traditional methods, especially those based on handcrafted features, are prone to overfitting, leading to poor performance on unseen data. This overfitting impairs generalization capabilities, making these methods less effective in real-world settings with differing data distributions.\n\nFurthermore, traditional methods struggle to generalize learned patterns across diverse scenes and conditions. This limitation is particularly evident in complex environments where object behavior and scene appearance vary significantly. Methods trained under specific conditions may fail to generalize well to new scenarios, curtailing their applicability and effectiveness.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn summary, traditional methods of video anomaly detection encounter numerous challenges that impede their effectiveness and scalability. These challenges include computational inefficiency, difficulty in handling dynamic scenes, extensive manual intervention requirements, limited adaptability and robustness, and overfitting and generalization issues. Addressing these challenges requires advanced techniques capable of efficient video data processing, adaptation to dynamic scenes, and generalization across varied conditions. The advent of deep learning methods, such as generative models and advanced architectures, offers promising solutions to these limitations, paving the way for more accurate and robust video anomaly detection systems [1].\n\n### 1.3 Potential of Deep Learning\n\nDeep learning (DL) represents a transformative shift in the field of video anomaly detection, offering a multitude of advantages over traditional methods. One of the primary strengths of DL lies in its capability to automatically learn complex patterns directly from raw data without the need for extensive hand-crafted feature engineering. This is particularly beneficial in video anomaly detection, where the dynamic nature of scenes and the variety of potential anomalies make it challenging to define comprehensive sets of features manually. Unlike traditional methods that rely on predefined rules or hand-engineered features, DL models can adapt to different types of anomalies and scenes by learning from the data itself, thereby enhancing detection accuracy and robustness.\n\nEnd-to-end learning is another significant advantage offered by DL. Traditional methods often require multiple stages of processing, where each stage involves distinct algorithms and models that may not be optimized together. In contrast, DL models can learn from raw video input to output anomaly scores or classifications in a unified framework. This allows for a more integrated and optimized approach, reducing the risk of errors that might arise from chaining multiple independent processes. Furthermore, end-to-end learning enables DL models to capture the intricate relationships between various spatiotemporal features and anomalies, leading to more accurate and reliable detection outcomes.\n\nDL's potential in video anomaly detection is also bolstered by its ability to handle high-dimensional data effectively. Videos contain vast amounts of spatial and temporal information, making it difficult for traditional methods to manage such data efficiently. DL models, particularly those with deep architectures, can process high-dimensional data by breaking it down into manageable components through layers of feature extraction and transformation. This capability is crucial for identifying subtle patterns and anomalies that might be overlooked by simpler methods. For instance, the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) in conjunction with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or transformers allows DL models to capture both local spatial details and global temporal dependencies, thereby improving their overall performance.\n\nAdvancements in hardware and software infrastructure further support the effectiveness of DL models in video anomaly detection. Powerful GPUs and distributed computing frameworks have significantly reduced the time required to train large-scale DL models, making it feasible to apply these models to real-world tasks. Additionally, improvements in data collection and storage technologies have facilitated the availability of larger and more diverse datasets, which are essential for training robust and generalized DL models.\n\nHowever, DL models also face certain challenges that must be addressed to fully realize their potential. One such challenge is the requirement for substantial amounts of labeled data to train models effectively. Traditional methods often rely on smaller, curated datasets, whereas DL models typically require extensive labeled data to learn meaningful representations. This can be a significant barrier in video anomaly detection, where obtaining large and diverse labeled datasets is often resource-intensive and time-consuming. The use of semi-supervised learning techniques can help mitigate this issue by leveraging unlabeled data alongside limited labeled data to improve model performance.\n\nDeploying DL models in real-world settings presents another challenge, as these models can be computationally intensive, particularly when dealing with high-resolution videos or real-time processing. Efficient DL architectures and deployment strategies are therefore essential for balancing performance with computational feasibility. Techniques such as pruning, quantization, and model compression can optimize DL models for practical applications.\n\nInterpretability remains a critical issue for DL models, as they are often viewed as black boxes. Enhancing model interpretability through methods like P2ExNet can foster greater trust and acceptance in critical domains by providing clear explanations for detection outcomes.\n\nIn summary, the potential of deep learning in video anomaly detection is vast and multifaceted. Through its ability to automatically learn complex patterns, perform end-to-end learning, and handle high-dimensional data, DL offers significant improvements over traditional methods. Realizing this potential requires addressing challenges related to data requirements, computational resources, and interpretability. As research advances in these areas, DL is poised to revolutionize video anomaly detection, leading to more accurate, efficient, and reliable detection systems.\n\n### 1.4 Overview of Deep Learning Approaches\n\nDeep learning techniques have revolutionized the field of video anomaly detection, offering a broad spectrum of solutions to tackle the complexities inherent in identifying unusual patterns within video streams. These approaches can be broadly categorized into generative models, discriminative models, and hybrid models, each leveraging different mechanisms to detect anomalies effectively. \n\nGenerative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and autoencoders, primarily focus on learning the distribution of normal behavior to identify deviations. GANs consist of a generator network that learns to produce realistic video sequences and a discriminator network that distinguishes between real and fake sequences. By training these components adversarially, GANs can effectively capture the nuances of normal behavior and detect anomalies when the discriminator fails to correctly classify a video sequence as real. Autoencoders, another prominent generative model, comprise an encoder that compresses the input data into a latent space and a decoder that reconstructs the original input from the compressed representation. Denoising autoencoders, which add noise to the input before training, can further enhance the model\u2019s robustness to noise and outliers, making them suitable for video anomaly detection.\n\nDiscriminative models, in contrast, rely on labeled data to train a classifier that distinguishes between normal and anomalous sequences. Multi-task deep neural networks are a notable example, where the network is trained on multiple related tasks simultaneously, enriching the feature space and improving anomaly detection performance. Integrating tasks such as object classification and object detection can provide rich contextual information that enhances the model\u2019s ability to identify anomalies based on unexpected or irregular behavior within the scene. Supervised contrastive learning, which aims to enhance feature discrimination by pushing similar instances closer and dissimilar ones farther apart, can be particularly effective in improving the model\u2019s generalization and robustness.\n\nHybrid models seek to leverage the strengths of both generative and discriminative models by combining unsupervised learning with supervised learning techniques. These models typically involve unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning, benefiting from unlabeled data while gaining the advantage of labeled data for refinement. Self-supervised learning strategies, such as pretext tasks, can guide the model to learn meaningful representations even without explicit labels. After pre-training, these models can be fine-tuned on smaller labeled datasets, leading to improved performance and reduced dependency on extensive labeled data.\n\nRecent advancements in deep learning for video anomaly detection have introduced novel architectures and methodologies that push the boundaries of traditional approaches. For instance, the Spatio-Temporal Attention Trans-Encoder (STATE) model integrates a learnable convolutional attention mechanism for efficient temporal learning and uses a reconstruction-based input perturbation technique during testing to enhance anomaly detection accuracy. This model demonstrates the potential of combining advanced attention mechanisms with traditional reconstruction-based approaches to achieve superior performance. Similarly, the Grid Hierarchical Temporal Memory (Grid HTM) model adapts the HTM algorithm specifically for video anomaly detection, leveraging its noise tolerance and online learning capabilities to provide a robust framework for handling the challenges associated with video anomaly detection.\n\nWhile these deep learning approaches have demonstrated remarkable success, they also face significant challenges and limitations. Generative models often require extensive computational resources and time for training, especially with large-scale datasets. Discriminative models, despite being more straightforward to implement, are heavily reliant on the quality and quantity of labeled data, which can be scarce and expensive to obtain. Hybrid models aim to balance the trade-offs but still face issues related to the alignment of unsupervised and supervised learning objectives. Additionally, the performance of these models can be sensitive to hyperparameter settings and the choice of evaluation metrics, underscoring the need for standardized benchmarks and evaluation frameworks.\n\n## 2 Overview of Datasets in Video Anomaly Detection\n\n### 2.1 Large-Scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) Database\n\nThe Large-Scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database stands as a pivotal resource in the realm of video anomaly detection, offering researchers a comprehensive and meticulously curated collection of video sequences that span across a wide range of scenarios and environments [1].

This mirrors the CHAD dataset\u2019s contribution to enhancing the real-world applicability of video anomaly detection models through its multi-camera setup and detailed annotations.\n\nThe LAD database also contributes to the development of more sophisticated and nuanced models by incorporating a wide variety of video sequences and anomaly types. For example, the inclusion of high-resolution videos and complex scenes challenges models to not only recognize simple anomalies but also to interpret more subtle and intricate patterns indicative of anomalous behavior. This complexity in the dataset promotes the advancement of deep learning architectures that can handle diverse and challenging video inputs, leading to more accurate and reliable anomaly detection systems. This aspect aligns with the CHAD dataset\u2019s focus on enhancing the realism and complexity of video anomaly detection tasks.\n\nAdditionally, the LAD database supports research in the refinement of anomaly scoring and decision-making processes. Given the detailed frame-level annotations, researchers can experiment with different methods for refining anomaly scores based on contextual information and temporal dynamics. This experimentation is vital for enhancing the overall performance of anomaly detection systems, as accurate anomaly scoring is crucial for distinguishing between false positives and true anomalies. By leveraging the rich labeling information in the LAD database, researchers can develop and validate algorithms that improve the accuracy and reliability of anomaly detection [7]. This approach is akin to the CHAD dataset\u2019s emphasis on precise localization and identity annotations for enhancing model performance.\n\nFurthermore, the LAD database aids in the identification of key challenges and research directions in fully-supervised video anomaly detection. Researchers can use the dataset to explore the limits of current models and identify areas where further improvements are needed. For instance, the database can be used to investigate the performance of models under varying levels of noise and occlusion, which are common challenges in real-world video surveillance scenarios. This exploration helps to refine existing models and guide the development of new techniques that are better suited to handle these complexities. This aligns with the CHAD dataset\u2019s role in pushing the boundaries of anomaly detection algorithms through its multi-camera setup and detailed annotations.\n\nIn conclusion, the Large-Scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database represents a cornerstone resource in the field of video anomaly detection, providing a robust and comprehensive dataset for the development and evaluation of fully-supervised learning paradigms.

Researchers aiming to innovate and advance the field must carefully choose datasets that not only cover a wide range of scenarios but also closely mirror the real-world complexities and challenges encountered in actual deployments. This involves considering several critical factors, each playing a pivotal role in ensuring that the chosen datasets provide meaningful insights and lead to the development of effective anomaly detection systems.\n\nFirstly, the variety of anomalies that the dataset should encompass is paramount. The nature of anomalies can be highly variable and context-dependent, making it essential to select datasets that include a diverse spectrum of anomalous behaviors. For instance, the Large-Scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database [9] includes a broad range of anomaly types, providing a rich ground for training models to recognize different kinds of unusual events. Such variability is essential for developing algorithms that can generalize across different environments and scenarios, thus enhancing their applicability in real-world settings.\n\nSecondly, the resolution and quality of the video data are critical. High-resolution video data, such as those found in the CHAD dataset [10], are invaluable for developing and validating anomaly detection models. These datasets offer detailed visual information, which is crucial for accurately identifying subtle anomalies that may be difficult to detect in lower-resolution videos. Furthermore, the inclusion of additional annotations like bounding boxes and identities in the CHAD dataset enhances the utility of the dataset, allowing researchers to develop more sophisticated models capable of distinguishing between different actors and objects.\n\nThe size and scale of the dataset also play a significant role. Large-scale datasets are preferred as they provide a substantial amount of training data, enabling the models to learn complex patterns and generalize better. The LAD database, for example, is known for its extensive collection of video sequences, facilitating the training of models on a large volume of data. This helps in mitigating issues related to overfitting and ensures that the models can handle the variability inherent in real-world video streams.\n\nTemporal dynamics are another factor that cannot be overlooked. Videos are inherently sequential, and capturing the temporal dependencies is crucial for effective anomaly detection. Therefore, datasets should ideally contain sequences long enough to capture the temporal evolution of events. For instance, the use of pre-trained deep convolutional neural nets and context mining highlights the importance of leveraging temporal information [11]. By incorporating temporal context, the models can better understand the normal behavior and detect deviations from this norm more accurately.\n\nReal-world conditions often involve noise and variations in lighting, weather, and camera angles. Datasets that account for these factors are essential for developing robust models. The HTM model's resilience to noise and its capability to perform online learning make it particularly suitable for dealing with such variations [9]. Therefore, datasets that incorporate realistic noise levels and environmental changes are necessary to ensure that the models can operate effectively under real-world conditions.\n\nAdditionally, the complexity and diversity of scenes should be considered. Videos from diverse settings, such as urban environments, industrial facilities, or indoor surveillance, require models that can adapt to different visual appearances and behaviors. This is particularly relevant in the context of industrial video anomaly detection, where specialized datasets like the IPAD dataset are designed to cover industrial devices and periodicity annotations [11]. By addressing the unique challenges posed by industrial environments, these datasets contribute to the development of more specialized and effective anomaly detection models.\n\nIt is also important to consider the balance between normal and anomalous data. Many real-world scenarios involve a significant imbalance between normal and anomalous events, with the latter being rare occurrences. Ensuring that the dataset reflects this imbalance is crucial for developing models that can detect anomalies efficiently. Moreover, the choice of datasets should align with the specific application domain and the intended use of the anomaly detection system. For instance, datasets designed for surveillance applications should prioritize the detection of security-relevant anomalies, whereas those intended for monitoring purposes may focus on detecting specific types of irregularities.\n\nFurthermore, the inclusion of contextual information can greatly enhance the effectiveness of anomaly detection models. Contextual cues, such as the presence of certain objects, time of day, or environmental conditions, can provide valuable insights into the likelihood of anomalies. Integrating such contextual information into the dataset enables the development of models that can leverage this auxiliary information to improve their performance. For example, the CHAD dataset includes additional annotations like bounding boxes and identities, which can be used to provide context for the anomaly detection process [10].\n\nIn addition to these factors, the selection of datasets should also take into account the computational constraints of the target application. For resource-constrained devices such as edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT), datasets that enable the development of lightweight models are essential. The use of pre-trained models and denoising autoencoders can provide efficient and accurate anomaly detection, even with relatively low model complexity [11]. Such approaches are particularly useful in environments where computational resources are limited.\n\nLastly, the evaluation of the models should be performed using datasets that reflect real-world conditions and challenges. This includes considering factors such as the variability of anomalies, the complexity of scenes, and the balance between normal and anomalous data. By ensuring that the evaluation datasets are representative of the target application domain, researchers can obtain a more accurate assessment of the model's performance and its readiness for deployment in real-world scenarios.\n\nIn summary, the selection of appropriate datasets for video anomaly detection research is a multifaceted process that requires careful consideration of various factors. From the diversity and complexity of anomalies to the resolution and quality of video data, each element plays a critical role in shaping the effectiveness of the developed models. By prioritizing datasets that closely mirror real-world conditions and challenges, researchers can pave the way for the development of more robust, reliable, and generalizable anomaly detection systems. This underscores the importance of thoughtfully selecting datasets that not only meet the specific needs of the research but also lay a solid foundation for advancing the field of video anomaly detection.\n\n## 3 Review of Deep Learning Models and Architectures\n\n### 3.1 Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)\n\nGenerative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are a class of deep learning models comprising two neural networks: a generator and a discriminator, trained adversarially against each other [1]. The generator aims to create synthetic samples that mimic the real data distribution, while the discriminator distinguishes between real and synthetic samples. In the context of video anomaly detection, GANs learn to reconstruct normal video sequences, with anomalies being identified through reconstruction errors. Specifically, the generator learns to produce frames that are indistinguishable from real ones, and the discriminator evaluates these frames alongside real frames. Any deviation between the generated and real frames indicates the presence of an anomaly [1].\n\nThe architecture of GANs for video anomaly detection typically involves encoding input video frames into latent space representations and then decoding them back into the original video domain. The generator generates video frames that resemble the normal behavior captured in the training set, whereas the discriminator evaluates the authenticity of these frames. Through training, the generator captures the underlying distribution of normal video sequences, allowing it to produce realistic reconstructions, while the discriminator refines its ability to detect discrepancies, thus enhancing the robustness of the anomaly detection system [1].\n\nGiven the sequential nature of video data, the training process of GANs for video anomaly detection is complex. One effective approach involves training a recurrent GAN (rGAN), where the generator and discriminator incorporate recurrent neural network (RNN) components, such as LSTM cells, to process and generate sequences of video frames. This setup enables the rGAN to learn coherent sequences of frames reflective of normal behavior, while the discriminator differentiates these sequences from actual video sequences, thereby improving the detection of abnormal events [1]. Alternatively, an encoder-decoder structure can be used, where the encoder maps video frames into a latent space, and the decoder reconstructs them. Here, the generator refines latent representations to improve reconstruction quality, and the discriminator evaluates the similarity between original and reconstructed frames [1].\n\nDuring training, the generator and discriminator engage in a zero-sum game. Initially, the generator struggles to produce realistic frames, resulting in high reconstruction errors and making it easy for the discriminator to distinguish real from synthetic frames. As training progresses, the generator enhances its ability to replicate normal patterns, reducing reconstruction errors. Consequently, the discriminator becomes more adept at identifying subtle deviations indicative of anomalies. This adversarial training ensures that the generator captures not only the statistical properties but also the nuanced aspects of normal behavior in video sequences [1].\n\nSeveral studies highlight the effectiveness of GANs in video anomaly detection. For instance, \"Efficient GAN-Based Anomaly Detection\" proposes integrating GANs with attention mechanisms to focus on regions of interest in video frames, thereby improving anomaly detection accuracy [1]. Another study, \"Video Anomaly Detection using GAN,\" introduces a framework utilizing GANs to generate synthetic normal frames and employs spatial and temporal attentions to pinpoint anomalies, further demonstrating the versatility of GANs [1].\n\nDespite these advancements, GANs face challenges, including mode collapse, where the generator fails to cover the full spectrum of normal video sequences. Addressing this issue requires careful design and training strategies, such as employing WGANs to stabilize the training process. Handling temporal dynamics also remains challenging, necessitating advanced sequence modeling techniques. Nonetheless, ongoing advancements in GAN architectures and training methods offer promising avenues for improving video anomaly detection [1].\n\n### 3.2 Autoencoders\n\nAutoencoders, a type of unsupervised learning model, have become increasingly popular for video anomaly detection due to their ability to learn compact representations of normal video patterns. At their core, autoencoders consist of an encoder that compresses input data into a lower-dimensional latent space and a decoder that reconstructs the original input from this latent representation. By training an autoencoder to accurately reconstruct input video frames, the model implicitly learns to represent normal patterns, enabling the detection of anomalies as deviations from this learned normality. The \"Deep Video Anomaly Detection Opportunities and Challenges\" paper highlights the use of autoencoders to model the distribution of normal video frames, thus establishing a probabilistic framework for anomaly detection.\n\nOne key variation is the denoising autoencoder (DAE), which is trained on noisy versions of the input data and tasked with reconstructing the clean input. This enhances the model's robustness against noise and variations in the input data, improving its generalization to unseen data. For instance, the \"Making Reconstruction-based Method Great Again for Video Anomaly Detection\" paper introduces a denoising technique that perturbs the input during the testing phase, increasing sensitivity to anomalies.\n\nConvolutional autoencoders (CAEs) are another effective variant, leveraging convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to extract spatial features from video frames. CAEs can learn hierarchical representations of spatial features through stacked convolutional layers, enabling the capture of both local and global features within the video sequence. This hierarchical structure contributes to more accurate reconstructions of normal patterns. Integrating LSTM layers with CAEs further enhances their capability to model temporal dynamics, capturing both spatial and temporal patterns essential for accurate anomaly detection. The \"Making Reconstruction-based Method Great Again for Video Anomaly Detection\" paper demonstrates the integration of LSTM layers with CAEs to better model temporal dependencies in video sequences.\n\nThe addition of LSTM layers allows the autoencoder to handle variations in the speed and timing of events within the video sequence, making it easier to differentiate between normal and anomalous events. This is particularly useful in surveillance settings where normal behavior can vary throughout the day. However, autoencoders face limitations such as overfitting, where the model becomes overly specialized in reproducing training data, leading to poor generalization. Regularization techniques like dropout and batch normalization help mitigate this issue. Additionally, anomalies may not always result in significant reconstruction errors, complicating their detection. To address these challenges, researchers introduce techniques like the Spatio-Temporal Attention Trans-Encoder (STATE) model, which uses a learnable convolutional attention mechanism to enhance the model\u2019s focus on relevant video segments. Perturbation techniques during testing also improve sensitivity to anomalies by simulating real-world conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, autoencoders offer a robust framework for learning normal video patterns, with variations like denoising and convolutional autoencoders, and the integration of LSTM layers, significantly enhancing their performance in capturing both spatial and temporal dynamics. Despite limitations, continuous advancements, such as the STATE model and perturbation techniques, continue to improve video anomaly detection capabilities.\n\n### 3.3 Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)\n\nHierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) is a biologically inspired machine learning framework designed to mimic the functionality of the neocortex. Unlike traditional deep learning models that rely on static, predefined layers, HTM dynamically learns spatial and temporal patterns from sequential data, enabling it to perform online learning effectively. This characteristic makes HTM particularly suitable for anomaly detection in video streams, where the ability to adapt to new patterns in real-time is crucial. The HTM model, originally proposed by Numenta, has been adapted for various applications, including video anomaly detection, where it excels in handling noisy data and adapting to evolving environments [12].\n\nBuilding upon the foundational concepts of HTM, the Grid HTM architecture stands out for its unique approach to learning and representing temporal dependencies. The Grid HTM architecture leverages the hierarchical nature of HTM to capture complex patterns at different levels of abstraction, thereby improving the model's ability to generalize from limited training data [12]. This hierarchical structure is crucial for handling the intricate spatiotemporal dynamics present in video sequences, making it well-suited for detecting subtle anomalies that may arise from small yet significant deviations in the input data.\n\nOne of the primary advantages of the Grid HTM architecture is its robustness to noise. Traditional deep learning models often require extensive preprocessing to filter out noise, which can be time-consuming and may lead to the loss of important information. In contrast, the Grid HTM architecture is designed to naturally accommodate noise in the input data. By learning representations that are robust to variations in the input, HTM models can maintain their performance even when presented with noisy or corrupted video frames. This robustness is achieved through the use of sparse distributed representations, where each input pattern is encoded using a distributed subset of neurons, ensuring that minor variations in the input do not significantly alter the overall representation [13].\n\nMoreover, the Grid HTM architecture supports online learning, a capability that is critical for real-time anomaly detection systems. Unlike batch learning, which updates models periodically after processing large sets of data, online learning allows HTM to adapt to changes in the data stream continuously. This feature enables the system to respond promptly to new patterns and adapt to evolving environments, making it particularly suitable for dynamic scenarios where anomalies may emerge unpredictably. Online learning also facilitates the integration of feedback loops, where the system can be iteratively refined based on real-time performance metrics, leading to continuous improvement in detection accuracy [14].\n\nThe Grid HTM architecture achieves these benefits through its layered structure, which mirrors the hierarchical organization of the neocortex. Each layer in the architecture processes information at a different level of abstraction, starting from raw pixel values to higher-order features. This hierarchical structure allows the model to capture both low-level details and high-level semantics, enabling it to discern subtle anomalies that might be missed by simpler models. Furthermore, the interconnections between layers facilitate the propagation of temporal information across scales, allowing the model to understand the context of anomalies within the larger sequence of events [15].\n\nAnother advantage of the Grid HTM architecture is its interpretability. Unlike black-box models such as deep neural networks, HTM models offer transparency into their decision-making process. The sparse distributed representations used by HTM enable the visualization of learned features, providing insight into what the model considers relevant for detecting anomalies. This interpretability is crucial for building trust in anomaly detection systems, especially in critical applications such as security and surveillance. Users can validate the model's reasoning and gain confidence in its ability to make accurate predictions, even in complex and noisy environments [16].\n\nDespite its numerous advantages, the Grid HTM architecture faces certain limitations. One of the primary challenges is the computational complexity associated with maintaining a hierarchical structure and processing spatiotemporal information. Training and inference operations can be resource-intensive, particularly when dealing with high-resolution video streams. Additionally, the performance of HTM models may be affected by the quality and diversity of the training data. Ensuring that the training set adequately represents the variety of anomalies and normal behaviors expected in real-world scenarios is crucial for achieving reliable detection performance [17].\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have explored various strategies to optimize the Grid HTM architecture. For instance, incorporating domain-specific knowledge into the training process can enhance the model's ability to generalize from limited data. Transfer learning techniques can be employed to leverage pre-trained models on similar tasks, reducing the amount of data required for training and accelerating convergence. Furthermore, the use of synthetic data generation methods, such as GANs, can augment the training set with realistic examples, improving the model's robustness to unseen anomalies [17].\n\nIn summary, the Grid HTM architecture represents a promising approach to video anomaly detection, offering a balance between performance, robustness, and interpretability. Its ability to handle noise and perform online learning positions it as a valuable tool for real-time anomaly detection systems. However, ongoing research is necessary to further optimize the architecture and address its computational demands. As the field continues to evolve, the integration of HTM with other advanced techniques, such as transformer networks and self-supervised learning, may unlock new possibilities for enhancing the capabilities of video anomaly detection systems [12].\n\n### 3.4 Advanced Models: STATE Model\n\n---\nThe Spatio-Temporal Attention Trans-Encoder (STATE) model, introduced in \"Making Reconstruction-based Method Great Again for Video Anomaly Detection,\" represents a significant advancement in deep learning techniques for video anomaly detection. This model is specifically designed to leverage the inherent spatiotemporal dynamics of video sequences, offering a refined approach to anomaly detection through a combination of learnable convolutional attention mechanisms and innovative input perturbation techniques during the testing phase. Building upon the robustness and adaptability discussed in the previous section, the STATE model further enhances these qualities, making it a strong contender for real-time anomaly detection systems.\n\nOne of the standout features of the STATE model is its utilization of a learnable convolutional attention mechanism, which allows for efficient temporal learning. Unlike traditional convolutional layers, which apply fixed filters across the entire input, the convolutional attention mechanism in the STATE model dynamically adjusts its filters based on the input data. This dynamic adjustment enhances the model\u2019s ability to capture temporal dependencies and spatial correlations within video sequences, leading to more accurate and context-aware anomaly detection. By enabling the model to adaptively focus on relevant features over time, the convolutional attention mechanism ensures that the STATE model can effectively distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors.\n\nMoreover, the STATE model introduces a reconstruction-based input perturbation technique during the testing phase, which further improves its performance in identifying anomalies. During testing, instead of simply reconstructing the input sequence, the model perturbs the input by adding slight variations before attempting to reconstruct it. This perturbation forces the model to generalize beyond the exact input patterns it has encountered during training, thereby enhancing its robustness against subtle deviations from normal behavior. By introducing controlled noise or variations, the STATE model becomes better equipped to detect anomalies that may arise from minor but significant changes in the video sequence.\n\nThe integration of these innovative components in the STATE model underscores its potential to outperform traditional deep learning models in video anomaly detection. For instance, traditional methods such as autoencoders and GANs often face limitations in capturing the intricate spatiotemporal relationships within video sequences. While these models can learn to reconstruct normal patterns effectively, they may struggle to handle the complexity and variability of real-world video data. In contrast, the STATE model leverages its learnable convolutional attention mechanism and reconstruction-based perturbation techniques to address these challenges more comprehensively.\n\nFurthermore, the STATE model's architecture is carefully designed to facilitate efficient computation and scalable deployment. By employing a series of lightweight convolutional layers and attention modules, the model minimizes the computational overhead typically associated with deep learning approaches. This design choice enables the STATE model to be deployed on a wider range of platforms, including resource-constrained devices such as edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT) ecosystem. Such flexibility is crucial for practical applications of video anomaly detection, where computational resources may be limited and real-time performance is often required.\n\nThe STATE model's ability to handle noise and concept drift is another critical advantage in video anomaly detection. Concept drift refers to the gradual change in the distribution of data over time, which poses a significant challenge for anomaly detection systems. The model's learnable attention mechanism allows it to adapt to changes in the input data, making it more resilient to concept drift compared to static models. Additionally, the reconstruction-based input perturbation technique helps the model maintain its performance even when faced with noisy or partially occluded video sequences. This robustness is particularly valuable in surveillance applications, where environmental conditions and scene dynamics can vary significantly.\n\nBy addressing the aforementioned challenges, the STATE model not only complements the advancements made by HTM and other hierarchical models but also opens new avenues for innovation in the realm of deep learning for video anomaly detection. The effectiveness of the STATE model in addressing these challenges is evident in its performance on various video anomaly detection benchmarks. In comparative evaluations with other state-of-the-art models, the STATE model consistently demonstrates superior performance, particularly in terms of accuracy and robustness. Its ability to generalize well across different types of anomalies and its reduced reliance on extensive labeled data make it a promising candidate for real-world deployment. Moreover, the STATE model's flexibility allows it to be adapted for specific application scenarios, such as industrial settings or public surveillance, by incorporating domain-specific knowledge and fine-tuning the model parameters accordingly.\n\nIn conclusion, the Spatio-Temporal Attention Trans-Encoder (STATE) model represents a significant step forward in the field of video anomaly detection. Through its innovative use of learnable convolutional attention mechanisms and reconstruction-based input perturbation techniques, the STATE model offers enhanced accuracy and robustness in detecting anomalies in video sequences. Its design considerations for efficient computation and scalability further position the model as a viable solution for practical applications. As the demand for intelligent video surveillance systems continues to grow, the STATE model stands out as a powerful tool for advancing the capabilities of video anomaly detection in diverse and challenging environments.\n\n## 4 Supervised vs. Unsupervised Strategies and Hybrid Models\n\n### 4.1 Supervised Approaches\n\nSupervised approaches in the context of video anomaly detection rely heavily on the availability of labeled data, consisting of both normal and anomalous video sequences. The fundamental principle of supervised learning involves training a model on this labeled dataset to classify video segments as either normal or anomalous. This method necessitates a comprehensive annotation effort, where every video sequence is meticulously labeled, marking the presence or absence of anomalies. Such a requirement poses a significant challenge due to the labor-intensive nature of manual annotation and the scarcity of large, annotated video datasets [3].\n\nModel structures in supervised video anomaly detection often include multi-task deep neural networks designed to handle multiple objectives simultaneously. For instance, these networks might be trained to perform anomaly detection alongside activity recognition, enriching the model's understanding of normal behavior patterns [2]. This dual-task setup leverages the interdependencies between activities and anomalies, potentially enhancing anomaly detection accuracy. However, the increased complexity and resource demands of such multi-task models necessitate robust computational infrastructure and large annotated datasets to prevent overfitting [1].\n\nRecent advancements have focused on enhancing feature discrimination through innovative training strategies like supervised contrastive learning. Contrastive learning aims to learn discriminative representations by contrasting similar and dissimilar instances. In video anomaly detection, supervised contrastive learning explicitly incorporates supervision signals to guide the model in distinguishing between normal and anomalous patterns more effectively [1]. This approach has shown promise in improving the model's ability to generalize across different types of anomalies and video content, providing a robust solution for anomaly detection [2].\n\nA key advantage of supervised approaches is their ability to leverage detailed annotations, enabling the model to learn intricate patterns of normal behavior that are difficult to capture through unsupervised methods. Explicitly labeling anomalies allows the model to focus on capturing nuanced differences between normal and abnormal behavior, especially useful in context-dependent scenarios such as surveillance [1].\n\nHowever, supervised learning faces inherent limitations, primarily due to the reliance on labeled data. Acquiring such data is expensive and time-consuming, particularly for video datasets requiring frame-by-frame annotations. Moreover, the generalizability of supervised models is constrained by the diversity and representativeness of the training dataset. Insufficient coverage of potential anomalies can lead to degraded performance in real-world applications [4].\n\nTo address these challenges, researchers have explored strategies to enhance model robustness and adaptability. Transfer learning, where a pre-trained model on a large dataset is fine-tuned on smaller, specialized datasets, allows for incorporating domain-specific knowledge while benefiting from rich feature representations [1]. Data augmentation techniques, such as temporal and spatial jittering, have also been used to artificially expand the training dataset, improving the model\u2019s ability to generalize to unseen anomalies [4].\n\nAttention mechanisms integrated into deep neural networks further contribute to improved performance by allowing the model to selectively focus on specific regions of interest within video frames [1]. By dynamically weighing the importance of different spatial and temporal features, these mechanisms facilitate a more refined understanding of underlying patterns, enhancing detection accuracy [2].\n\nDespite these advancements, practical deployment remains constrained by the need for extensive labeled data. Efforts to mitigate this issue have explored semi-supervised and weakly supervised approaches, aiming to leverage unlabeled data to complement limited labeled data [18]. These approaches strive to balance the accuracy of supervised methods with the scalability of unsupervised learning, offering a viable path toward broader adoption of video anomaly detection technologies [4].\n\nIn conclusion, supervised approaches provide a powerful framework for achieving high accuracy in detecting anomalies through detailed annotations. However, the reliance on labeled data presents significant challenges, necessitating ongoing research into strategies that enhance the efficiency and adaptability of these models. As the field progresses, integrating advanced training techniques and developing more robust, generalizable models will be essential in overcoming remaining limitations and expanding the applicability of supervised video anomaly detection systems [3].\n\n### 4.2 Unsupervised Approaches\n\nUnsupervised approaches in video anomaly detection primarily leverage the inherent structure of video data to identify patterns that deviate from the norm without relying on labeled data. These methods are particularly advantageous due to their ability to handle large volumes of unlabeled data, thereby addressing the challenge of data scarcity often encountered in specialized anomaly detection scenarios. Self-supervised learning (SSL), a prominent strategy within unsupervised learning, enables models to learn useful representations by predicting certain aspects of the input data itself [1].\n\nAt the core of SSL lies the creation of pretext tasks that compel the model to learn meaningful representations of normal behavior in video sequences. Common pretext tasks include predicting the next frame in a sequence, recovering masked regions, or classifying scrambled segments. Through these tasks, the model acquires a deep understanding of the underlying structure and dynamics of video data, capturing both temporal and spatial dependencies [19]. Once the model learns these representations, anomaly detection becomes a matter of identifying instances that deviate significantly from the established norms.\n\nOne of the most significant benefits of unsupervised methods, particularly SSL, is the substantial reduction in the need for labeled data. The process of labeling video sequences for anomaly detection is laborious and costly, especially when dealing with high-definition and lengthy videos. By utilizing SSL, researchers can tap into the vast pools of unlabeled data available in surveillance and monitoring systems, thereby democratizing access to advanced anomaly detection techniques [3]. Additionally, unsupervised methods are inherently adaptable to evolving environments, making them ideal for real-world applications where anomalies may change over time.\n\nSeveral innovative pretext tasks have been developed to enhance the performance of unsupervised video anomaly detection models. The spatio-temporal jigsaw puzzle task, for example, trains the model to reconstruct the correct order of shuffled video segments, encouraging it to learn discriminative features that encapsulate both appearance and motion characteristics of normal behavior [20]. Another promising approach involves using transformers to predict future frames based on past ones, effectively capturing the spatio-temporal context of video sequences [21].\n\nA recent advancement in SSL for video anomaly detection is the Self-supervised vIsion Transformer (SiT) [21], which demonstrates the capability of transformers to capture long-range dependencies and complex spatio-temporal relationships. By training on tasks that require predicting missing frames, SiT fosters the development of robust representations that remain resilient to noise and variations in the video data. This resilience is vital for anomaly detection, as anomalies frequently appear as deviations from learned normal patterns.\n\nComplementary to SiT, other SSL strategies have been introduced to further enhance the model's capabilities. For instance, the Mix-up technique creates synthetic training examples by blending pairs of labeled samples, facilitating a smoother decision boundary that aids in generalizing from normal to anomalous behavior [22]. Similarly, the Moving Objects Clustering Algorithm (MOCA) uses clustering to identify and track moving objects across frames, generating a dense scene representation that can be utilized for anomaly detection [23].\n\nTo ensure effective anomaly detection, unsupervised methods must capture the essence of normal behavior while remaining sensitive to deviations indicative of anomalies. This often involves incorporating regularization mechanisms to prevent the model from becoming overly specialized to the training data. Compactness and separateness losses, for example, promote representations that are both compact and well-separated, thereby improving the model's distinction between normal and anomalous behavior [1].\n\nIn summary, unsupervised approaches, particularly those utilizing SSL, provide a powerful alternative to traditional supervised methods for video anomaly detection. By leveraging the inherent structure of video data and learning meaningful representations through pretext tasks, these methods can effectively identify anomalies without the need for extensive labeled data. As research advances, we can anticipate further innovations that will bolster the robustness, efficiency, and adaptability of unsupervised video anomaly detection systems.\n\n### 4.3 Hybrid Models\n\nHybrid models represent a sophisticated approach in video anomaly detection by combining the strengths of supervised and unsupervised learning strategies to enhance detection performance, robustness, and adaptability. These models typically leverage unsupervised learning to pre-train on large volumes of unlabeled data, allowing them to capture the intrinsic patterns and structures within normal video sequences. After pre-training, supervised fine-tuning on smaller, labeled datasets is conducted to calibrate and refine the model\u2019s ability to accurately detect anomalies. This dual-stage process ensures that hybrid models can generalize well to unseen data while still benefiting from the detailed guidance provided by labeled examples.\n\nA notable hybrid approach involves using pre-trained deep neural networks, such as those derived from vision transformers, which are initially trained using unsupervised techniques on large datasets. This initial phase enables the model to develop a rich understanding of normal video behaviors, forming the foundation for subsequent supervised fine-tuning. The effectiveness of this unsupervised pre-training stage lies in its ability to mitigate overfitting, a common issue when training solely on small labeled datasets. By initializing the model with knowledge from vast amounts of unlabeled data, it can better generalize and perform robustly across diverse scenarios.\n\nDuring the supervised fine-tuning phase, the model is adjusted with task-relevant data to specifically identify anomalies. This fine-tuning refines the model\u2019s parameters based on labeled data, ensuring accurate differentiation between normal and abnormal behaviors. This stage is critical for the model\u2019s primary function of anomaly detection, leveraging the broad understanding from the pre-training phase to inform its decision-making processes.\n\nIntegrating supervised fine-tuning into hybrid models offers several advantages. First, it enhances adaptability to specific application domains through fine-tuning with relevant data. Second, it improves robustness against overfitting, which can occur with limited labeled data. Third, it ensures high performance even with scarce labeled data, a common challenge in real-world applications.\n\nMoreover, hybrid models can incorporate advanced techniques like semi-supervised learning, where a portion of the data is labeled and the rest remains unlabeled. This strategy maximizes the benefits of the hybrid approach, allowing efficient use of limited labeled data while leveraging vast unlabeled data. Methods such as self-labeling and pseudo-labeling enable iterative improvements by treating confident predictions as additional labeled data, enhancing generalization from limited labeled data to broader distributions of normal and anomalous behaviors.\n\nHybrid models can also dynamically adjust their learning processes to accommodate evolving anomalies. Real-world anomalies can change over time, necessitating continuous updates to the model\u2019s understanding of normal behavior. Online learning mechanisms allow real-time parameter updates as new data arrives, valuable in applications like surveillance where anomalies manifest unexpectedly.\n\nAdditionally, hybrid models can integrate explainability techniques to provide interpretable outputs. While deep learning models are opaque, hybrid models can be designed with transparency mechanisms, such as generating heatmaps or saliency maps that highlight key regions in video frames contributing to anomaly detection. These explainability features build trust and facilitate debugging.\n\nPractically, hybrid models have shown superior performance in video anomaly detection benchmarks. Studies demonstrate that models combining unsupervised pre-training and supervised fine-tuning outperform purely supervised or unsupervised models in terms of accuracy and robustness. This enhanced performance stems from leveraging broad understanding from unsupervised pre-training and refined anomaly detection from supervised fine-tuning.\n\nHowever, the effectiveness of hybrid models depends on factors like data quality and quantity, pre-training objectives, and fine-tuning strategies. Integration into real-world systems requires careful consideration of computational resources, especially for edge device deployment with strict resource constraints.\n\nResearchers address these challenges through optimization techniques such as quantization and pruning, reducing computational overhead and memory requirements for hybrid models. Specialized hardware accelerators and efficient inference frameworks also advance the feasibility of real-time deployments.\n\nIn conclusion, hybrid models offer a promising avenue for advancing video anomaly detection by integrating the complementary strengths of supervised and unsupervised learning. Leveraging large unlabeled data for pre-training and precise anomaly detection through supervised fine-tuning positions them as robust and versatile solutions for a wide range of anomaly detection tasks. Future research should focus on refining architectures, optimizing training strategies, and enhancing explainability for broader real-world applicability.\n\n### 4.4 Comparative Analysis\n\n---\nComparative Analysis\n\nTo thoroughly understand the effectiveness of different approaches in video anomaly detection, it is essential to conduct a detailed comparative analysis of supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid models. Each paradigm presents distinct strengths and limitations, making certain scenarios more suitable for one method over another.\n\nSupervised learning relies on labeled data to train models, ensuring they learn to recognize normal behavior patterns effectively. These models often exhibit higher accuracy and reliability when trained on sufficiently large datasets, making them ideal for scenarios where labeled data is readily available. For instance, \"Video Anomaly Detection Using Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Nets and Context Mining\" [11] demonstrates how pre-trained models combined with denoising autoencoders can achieve competitive performance on resource-constrained devices, highlighting the practicality of supervised models in real-world applications. However, the reliance on labeled data poses significant challenges, particularly in obtaining extensive and accurate annotations for large-scale video datasets. Furthermore, the cost and effort required to annotate data can be prohibitive, limiting the scalability and generalizability of supervised approaches. Despite these limitations, supervised methods remain advantageous in controlled environments with well-defined and easily annotated anomalies.\n\nIn contrast, unsupervised learning does not require labeled data, enabling models to learn directly from the inherent structure and distribution of the input data. This characteristic makes unsupervised models highly adaptable and capable of detecting anomalies without prior knowledge of what constitutes normal behavior. Generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders are prominent examples of unsupervised models used in video anomaly detection. \"Exploring Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection\" [24] showcases the superior performance of diffusion models over conventional GANs and autoencoders, emphasizing the potential of newer generative models to enhance anomaly detection accuracy. However, unsupervised models often struggle with overfitting and require careful tuning to avoid generating artifacts or false positives. Additionally, the absence of labeled data makes it challenging to evaluate and validate model performance rigorously, necessitating alternative evaluation metrics that assess model robustness and generalizability.\n\nHybrid models aim to leverage the advantages of both supervised and unsupervised learning by integrating elements of both paradigms. These models typically involve unsupervised pre-training followed by supervised fine-tuning on smaller, labeled datasets. This approach enables models to benefit from the vast amount of unlabeled data available, while also incorporating domain-specific knowledge through supervised training. \"Deep Video Anomaly Detection Opportunities and Challenges\" [1] highlights the effectiveness of hybrid models in balancing the trade-off between data efficiency and model accuracy. By leveraging unsupervised pre-training, these models can learn rich feature representations that capture the essence of normal behavior, subsequently fine-tuned to improve detection performance on specific anomalies. However, the success of hybrid models depends heavily on the quality and relevance of the pre-training data, as well as the ability to transfer learned representations effectively to the target domain. In scenarios with limited labeled data, hybrid models offer a promising solution by enhancing model robustness and adaptability.\n\nDifferent approaches tend to outperform others depending on the specific characteristics of the video datasets and the nature of anomalies to be detected. For instance, in environments with well-defined anomalies and ample labeled data, such as industrial surveillance or traffic monitoring, supervised models are likely to yield superior results due to their ability to learn fine-grained distinctions between normal and abnormal behaviors. On the other hand, unsupervised models excel in scenarios where anomalies are less predictable and labeled data is scarce, such as in open-source surveillance or public spaces. Here, the adaptability of unsupervised models allows them to generalize better to unseen anomalies without the need for extensive labeling. Hybrid models bridge the gap between these extremes, offering a versatile solution for environments where labeled data is partially available and anomalies are complex and varied.\n\nMoreover, the choice of approach is also influenced by the computational constraints and resource availability in deployment settings. Supervised models, despite their accuracy, often require substantial computational resources for training, making them less suitable for real-time applications on resource-constrained devices. In contrast, unsupervised models, especially those based on lightweight architectures like diffusion models, can be more efficiently deployed on edge devices without compromising performance. Hybrid models, by combining the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning, offer a balanced solution that optimizes performance while accommodating varying levels of computational resources and data availability.\n\nIn summary, the comparative analysis reveals that each approach\u2014supervised, unsupervised, and hybrid\u2014has its own set of advantages and limitations in video anomaly detection. Supervised models excel in environments with abundant labeled data, providing high accuracy and reliability. Unsupervised models shine in situations with limited labeled data and unpredictable anomalies, showcasing adaptability and generalizability. Hybrid models offer a flexible solution by combining the benefits of both paradigms, optimizing performance across a wide range of scenarios. Ultimately, the choice of approach should align with the specific requirements of the application domain, taking into account factors such as data availability, computational resources, and the nature of anomalies to be detected. Through continued research and innovation, the effectiveness and versatility of these models will continue to evolve, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable video anomaly detection systems.\n---\n\n## 5 Feature Extraction and Representation Learning\n\n### 5.1 Spatiotemporal Feature Extraction Techniques\n\nSpatiotemporal feature extraction is a fundamental aspect of video anomaly detection, aiming to capture both the static characteristics of individual frames and the dynamic patterns across time. Building upon the foundational principles discussed in the preceding sections, this subsection explores the methodologies employed to extract these features, emphasizing their role in understanding normal behavior within video sequences.\n\nOne common approach to spatiotemporal feature extraction involves the utilization of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks, either independently or in conjunction. CNNs excel at learning spatial features from static images, while LSTMs are adept at modeling sequential data by capturing long-term dependencies [1]. The combination of these two architectures in a video anomaly detection model allows for a comprehensive understanding of the temporal evolution of anomalies, providing a robust foundation for detecting deviations from the norm.\n\nTemporal dynamics are critical for distinguishing normal behavior from anomalies. Traditional methods often relied on handcrafted features such as optical flow, motion vectors, and histograms of oriented gradients (HOG) [2]. However, deep learning models have increasingly shifted towards learning these features automatically. For instance, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and autoencoders are frequently employed to learn a latent space representation of normal behavior, where anomalies manifest as outliers in this learned space [4].\n\nGenerative models like GANs and autoencoders offer a powerful framework for spatiotemporal feature extraction. GANs, in particular, can be trained to generate synthetic video frames that resemble normal behavior, allowing the model to learn a distribution of normal activity [1]. By comparing real video frames to the generated ones, the model can identify discrepancies indicative of anomalies. Similarly, autoencoders can compress video frames into a lower-dimensional latent space, where the reconstruction error serves as a measure of anomaly [4].\n\nRecent advancements in transformer architectures have also shown promise in capturing spatiotemporal dependencies in video data. Vision transformers (ViTs) have been utilized for self-supervised learning in video anomaly detection, where they learn to predict future frames or mask regions in videos, thereby acquiring a rich understanding of the spatiotemporal relationships within the video sequences [6]. These models can effectively generalize to unseen anomalies by learning the intrinsic structure of normal video content.\n\nAttention mechanisms have also proven effective in refining the anomaly detection process. For instance, the Spatio-Temporal Attention Trans-Encoder (STATE) model incorporates a learnable convolutional attention mechanism to efficiently capture temporal dependencies [18]. This mechanism helps in refining the anomaly scores by integrating multiple streams of information, leading to improved detection accuracy.\n\nThe choice of feature extraction method often depends on the specific application domain and the nature of the anomalies being detected. For example, in surveillance systems, anomalies might include sudden movements, crowd disturbances, or unusual patterns of activity [7]. Here, feature extraction techniques that can effectively capture rapid changes in spatial and temporal dynamics are advantageous. Conversely, in industrial settings, anomalies might involve equipment malfunctions or operational irregularities, necessitating feature extraction methods that can detect subtle deviations from standard operating procedures [18].\n\nPose-based feature extraction techniques offer a promising alternative by alleviating privacy concerns while still providing valuable insights into anomalous behavior. These models focus on human body keypoints extracted from video frames, offering a more abstract yet informative representation of human activities [7]. Such models are less sensitive to background noise and can effectively capture the dynamics of human interactions, making them particularly useful in scenarios where visual anonymity is required.\n\nMoreover, the integration of memory modules in deep learning models enhances the representation and memorization of normal patterns, further aiding in the identification of anomalies. Memory-augmented neural networks, such as the Grid Hierarchical Temporal Memory (Grid HTM) model, integrate external memory components that can store and retrieve information relevant to the current video frame, contributing to the model's robustness against noise and improving its ability to perform online learning [3].\n\nDespite these advancements, several challenges remain in spatiotemporal feature extraction for video anomaly detection. Variability in anomalies across different application domains can make it difficult to generalize feature extraction methods. Additionally, the presence of concept drift, where the underlying patterns of normal behavior change over time, poses a significant challenge, requiring models to continuously adapt to evolving environments [8]. Furthermore, the scarcity of labeled data remains a bottleneck, particularly in unsupervised and semi-supervised learning scenarios, limiting the effectiveness of certain feature extraction techniques.\n\nIn conclusion, spatiotemporal feature extraction techniques play a pivotal role in video anomaly detection by enabling models to discern normal behavior from anomalies. Through the use of deep learning architectures like CNNs, LSTMs, transformers, and attention mechanisms, these models can capture both spatial and temporal dynamics essential for accurate anomaly detection. The integration of memory modules further enhances the robustness and adaptability of these models, paving the way for improved performance in real-world applications.\n\n### 5.2 Role of Memory Modules in Learning Normality\n\nMemory modules have become increasingly integrated into deep learning models for video anomaly detection, significantly enhancing their capability to represent and memorize normal patterns. These modules play a crucial role in improving the robustness of anomaly detection systems and reducing the risk of overfitting, which is particularly critical in the context of video anomaly detection where models need to generalize well across diverse and dynamic video sequences.\n\nFor instance, Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithms, such as the Grid HTM, leverage a hierarchical structure to store and recall representative samples of normal behaviors. This capability is vital for distinguishing between normal and anomalous instances effectively. The Grid HTM architecture, specifically designed for video anomaly detection, uses a grid structure to manage the spatial distribution of features, thereby improving the model's capacity to handle complex visual patterns and maintain stability over time [9].\n\nSimilarly, long short-term memory (LSTM) networks or their variants, when integrated into models, allow for the capture of temporal dependencies in video data. LSTM-based autoencoders, for example, can learn more sophisticated temporal dynamics and store intermediate representations that are characteristic of normal behavior. This integration prevents the model from simply learning the identity function, thus avoiding overfitting to the training data and remaining sensitive to true anomalies [22].\n\nMemory-augmented neural networks (MANNs) are another class of models that incorporate memory mechanisms to enhance performance. MANNs consist of a controller network interacting with a memory bank, which allows for the dynamic storage and retrieval of information about normal patterns. This design helps maintain a rich representation of video content and adapt to changes over time, improving the detection of anomalies. By utilizing external memory, MANNs can store detailed information about normal patterns and generalize to new data, thereby reducing the risk of overfitting and enhancing robustness [1].\n\nFurthermore, the integration of memory modules facilitates the development of more interpretable models. HTM models, due to their biological inspiration, offer a transparent mechanism for understanding how normal patterns are encoded and recalled. This interpretability is particularly valuable in security applications where trust in the model's predictions is crucial.\n\nHowever, implementing memory modules in deep learning models for video anomaly detection presents challenges. Managing memory capacity is a significant issue, as larger memory modules can increase computational demands and prolong training times. Ensuring that the stored information is relevant and representative of the wide array of normal behaviors that can occur in video sequences is another challenge. This requires carefully designed memory update rules and mechanisms for forgetting irrelevant information, processes that can impact the model's performance and robustness.\n\nDespite these challenges, the benefits of incorporating memory modules are substantial. They enhance the models' ability to generalize across diverse and dynamic video sequences by enabling the storage and retrieval of representative samples of normal behavior. Memory modules contribute to the development of more robust, adaptable, and interpretable models, ultimately improving the reliability and accuracy of video anomaly detection systems.\n\nIn summary, the integration of memory modules represents a promising direction in advancing deep learning models for video anomaly detection. These modules not only facilitate the memorization and recall of normal patterns but also reduce the risk of overfitting and enhance the robustness of the models. As research progresses, memory-augmented models are expected to become more sophisticated, leading to improved performance and broader applicability in real-world scenarios.\n\n### 5.3 Compactness and Separateness Losses\n\nIn the context of video anomaly detection, refining learned representations is crucial for enhancing the model's capability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior. Two key strategies contributing significantly to this goal are compactness and separateness losses. These losses aim to optimize the learned representations by ensuring that normal behaviors are tightly clustered and that anomalous behaviors are distinctly separated.\n\nCompactness loss is designed to ensure that representations of normal behavior in the learned space are tightly clustered. This means that the model should effectively capture the intrinsic structure of normal behavior, minimizing intra-class variation. By enforcing compact clustering, the model improves its generalization to unseen normal instances, reducing the likelihood of misclassifying them as anomalies. Compactness can be quantified using metrics like the mean pairwise distance between samples within the same class; a lower mean pairwise distance indicates a more compact cluster, which is beneficial for distinguishing normal from anomalous behavior.\n\nSeparateness loss, conversely, maximizes the distance between clusters of normal and anomalous behaviors, ensuring that anomalous behaviors are clearly identifiable. This increases inter-class variability, improving the model\u2019s ability to detect outliers. Since anomalies often represent rare or unusual events differing significantly from normal behaviors, a clear separation enhances accurate anomaly identification.\n\nImplementing compactness and separateness losses in video anomaly detection models involves modifying the loss function used during training. Traditional loss functions, such as cross-entropy, are augmented with these components to guide the learning process toward more informative representations. For instance, compactness loss might be formulated as the average pairwise distance between normal samples, while separateness loss could be defined as the minimum distance between normal and anomalous clusters. Combining these with the primary loss function creates an objective balancing accurate classification with the need for compact and separable representations.\n\nThese losses have been applied in various contexts, including deep generative models like autoencoders and GANs. For instance, denoising autoencoders, which reconstruct clean representations from noisy inputs, benefit from compactness and separateness losses to better capture normal behavior\u2019s underlying structure while distinguishing it from anomalies. Compactness ensures reconstructed normal video representations are closely grouped, reflecting high consistency, while separateness maintains a clear boundary between normal and anomalous reconstructions for accurate anomaly detection.\n\nAdditionally, compactness and separateness losses have been explored in hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) models. HTM, a biologically inspired model mimicking the neocortex, refines representations to capture normal behavior\u2019s temporal dynamics and distinguish anomalies. Compactness ensures sequential frames within normal video sequences are tightly clustered, reflecting continuity and coherence, whereas separateness ensures deviations from normal patterns are clearly identifiable as anomalies.\n\nBeyond training, these losses aid in evaluating learned representations\u2019 quality. Analyzing compactness and separateness provides insights into learning strategies' effectiveness. Models producing representations with high compactness and separateness tend to perform better in anomaly detection compared to those with less structured representations.\n\nHowever, effectively using these losses presents challenges. Balancing the two losses is critical; excessive focus on compactness may limit the captured normal behavior range, causing false negatives, while prioritizing separateness might not adequately capture normal behavior, leading to false positives. Careful tuning of loss weights is essential for optimal performance. Computational complexity, especially in large datasets, is another challenge, requiring efficient approximation methods and parallel processing. Selecting appropriate distance metrics based on specific data and tasks also impacts effectiveness.\n\nDespite these challenges, compactness and separateness losses significantly improve video anomaly detection models by promoting compact and separable representations, enhancing the model\u2019s ability to capture normal behavior\u2019s essence and identify deviations indicating anomalies. This, in turn, boosts overall accuracy and reliability. Continued exploration and refinement of these losses hold great promise for advancing video anomaly detection.\n\n### 5.4 Cross-Branch Feed-Forward Networks for Anomaly Scoring\n\n---\nCross-Branch Feed-Forward Networks for Anomaly Scoring\n\nRefining anomaly scores to achieve higher accuracy is one of the key challenges in video anomaly detection. Cross-branch feed-forward networks (CBFFNs) have emerged as a powerful tool to address this issue by integrating multiple streams of information, leading to enhanced detection performance. Building upon the concepts of compactness and separateness discussed earlier, CBFFNs leverage the strengths of both feature extraction and representation learning by combining information from various branches, each specialized in capturing distinct aspects of video sequences.\n\nThe concept of CBFFNs is rooted in the idea of exploiting multiple perspectives to better understand and classify video content. These networks typically consist of several branches that process different types of inputs or features. Each branch is responsible for extracting specific information relevant to the task, such as spatial details, temporal dynamics, or contextual cues. By fusing the outputs of these branches, CBFFNs can generate a more comprehensive representation of the video sequence, thereby improving the accuracy of anomaly detection.\n\nIn the context of video anomaly detection, CBFFNs can be designed to integrate information from different sources, including appearance, motion, and contextual features. For instance, one branch may focus on extracting visual features using convolutional layers, another branch could capture motion patterns through optical flow or trajectory analysis, and yet another branch might incorporate contextual information such as object categories or spatial relationships. This multi-stream approach allows CBFFNs to effectively handle the complex spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in video data, building on the principles of compact and separable representations discussed in the previous section.\n\nTo refine anomaly scores, CBFFNs utilize a combination of cross-branch fusion mechanisms and post-processing techniques. The cross-branch fusion step involves merging the outputs of individual branches to create a unified representation that captures the essential characteristics of normal behavior. This can be achieved through various methods, such as concatenation, averaging, or attention-based mechanisms. The choice of fusion strategy depends on the specific requirements of the application and the nature of the inputs being processed. Once the cross-branch fusion is completed, the unified representation is fed into a post-processing module designed to enhance the discrimination between normal and anomalous patterns. This module typically includes layers such as fully connected layers, normalization layers, and activation functions. The post-processing step is crucial for transforming the fused representation into a more interpretable and discriminative form, which can be used to compute anomaly scores. These scores indicate the likelihood of a given video segment containing an anomaly, allowing for more accurate detection of unusual events.\n\nThe effectiveness of CBFFNs in refining anomaly scores has been demonstrated in several studies. For example, in 'A Unifying Review of Deep and Shallow Anomaly Detection', the authors explore the use of cross-branch feed-forward networks for anomaly detection, emphasizing their ability to integrate diverse information streams. They highlight the importance of designing effective fusion strategies to ensure that the combined representation captures the salient features of normal behavior. Additionally, the paper underscores the need for careful tuning of post-processing modules to optimize the refinement of anomaly scores.\n\nMoreover, in 'Learning Deep Representations of Appearance and Motion for Anomalous Event Detection', the authors introduce the Appearance and Motion DeepNet (AMDN) framework, which employs CBFFNs to combine appearance and motion features. The AMDN framework consists of separate stacks of denoising autoencoders for appearance and motion, followed by a joint representation layer that combines the outputs of these stacks. The combined representation is then used to predict anomaly scores using multiple one-class SVM models. The late fusion strategy employed in AMDN ensures that the refined scores are highly discriminative, enabling more accurate detection of anomalous events.\n\nThe use of CBFFNs in video anomaly detection also extends to scenarios involving resource-constrained devices, such as edge devices in the Internet of Things (IoT). For instance, in 'Video Anomaly Detection Using Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Nets and Context Mining', the authors demonstrate how CBFFNs can be utilized to perform efficient and accurate anomaly detection on resource-limited devices. By leveraging pre-trained convolutional neural nets for feature extraction and context mining, followed by a denoising autoencoder for anomaly scoring, they achieve comparable performance to state-of-the-art approaches with relatively low model complexity. The CBFFN architecture enables the network to effectively integrate high-level features derived from object classification and detection, enhancing the robustness and accuracy of anomaly detection.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of CBFFNs with other advanced techniques, such as hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) and deep probabilistic models, has shown promising results in addressing the challenges of video anomaly detection. For example, in 'Grid HTM Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Anomaly Detection in Videos', the authors introduce the Grid HTM architecture, which incorporates CBFFNs to refine anomaly scores. The Grid HTM model utilizes a grid-like structure to handle complex video sequences, allowing it to efficiently process large-scale data. By incorporating CBFFNs, the model can effectively combine spatial and temporal information, leading to improved detection accuracy and reduced overfitting risk.\n\nIn summary, cross-branch feed-forward networks play a pivotal role in refining anomaly scores and enhancing the accuracy of video anomaly detection systems. By integrating multiple streams of information, CBFFNs can create more comprehensive and discriminative representations, enabling more reliable detection of anomalous events. The success of CBFFNs in various applications underscores their versatility and effectiveness in addressing the complex challenges of video anomaly detection. As research in this area continues to advance, CBFFNs are expected to remain a valuable tool for improving the performance of anomaly detection models across different domains and scenarios.\n---\n\n## 6 Evaluation Metrics and Challenges\n\n### 6.1 Common Evaluation Metrics\n\nWhen evaluating the performance of video anomaly detection models, researchers rely on a suite of metrics to comprehensively assess the effectiveness of different approaches. Among these metrics, the Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision-recall curves, and the F1-score are widely adopted due to their versatility and ability to capture distinct facets of a model\u2019s performance. These metrics provide valuable insights into the true positive rate, false positive rate, and the balance between precision and recall, thus facilitating a nuanced understanding of model efficacy across various datasets and application contexts.\n\n**Area Under the Curve (AUC)** is a widely accepted metric for evaluating binary classifiers and has found extensive use in video anomaly detection. The AUC represents the probability that a classifier will rank a randomly chosen positive instance higher than a randomly chosen negative instance. It is calculated as the area under the ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) curve, which plots the true positive rate against the false positive rate at various threshold settings. The AUC ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. AUC is particularly advantageous because it provides a single scalar measure that is insensitive to the class distribution, making it suitable for imbalanced datasets common in anomaly detection. For instance, in \"Deep Video Anomaly Detection: Opportunities and Challenges,\" the authors advocate for AUC as a reliable metric for evaluating the robustness of deep learning models in detecting anomalies across different surveillance scenarios [1].\n\nPrecision-recall curves offer another perspective on model performance, focusing specifically on the trade-offs between precision and recall. Precision measures the proportion of true positives among the predicted positives, whereas recall (also known as sensitivity) measures the proportion of true positives correctly identified by the model. By plotting precision against recall, these curves enable a detailed examination of a model's performance at different thresholds. The area under the precision-recall curve (AUPRC) is often used as an integrated metric, similar to AUC, providing a quantitative measure of a model's ability to identify true positives while minimizing false positives. This metric is particularly useful when the cost of false positives is high, as is often the case in security and surveillance applications [3]. For example, a model that excels in a high-precision regime may be preferable in a scenario where minimizing false alarms is crucial, despite potentially missing some true anomalies.\n\nThe F1-score combines precision and recall into a single metric, providing a balanced measure of a model's accuracy. Defined as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, the F1-score ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating better performance. The F1-score is particularly useful in scenarios where the classes are imbalanced, as it penalizes models that perform poorly on either precision or recall. In video anomaly detection, the F1-score helps in assessing the overall effectiveness of a model, balancing its ability to correctly identify anomalies (recall) with its ability to avoid false positives (precision).\n\nThese metrics collectively contribute to a comprehensive evaluation framework for video anomaly detection models. While AUC provides a holistic view of a model's ability to distinguish between normal and anomalous behavior, precision-recall curves offer insights into the model's performance under varying operational conditions. The F1-score, on the other hand, strikes a balance between precision and recall, ensuring that models do not overly favor one aspect of performance at the expense of the other. Together, these metrics facilitate a nuanced assessment of model performance, enabling researchers and practitioners to make informed decisions regarding model selection and optimization.\n\nMoreover, these metrics are not only crucial for evaluating individual models but also for comparing different approaches and algorithms. By providing a standardized framework for assessment, these metrics facilitate the identification of best practices and the establishment of benchmarks for future research. For instance, when comparing different deep learning architectures, such as GANs, autoencoders, and hybrid models, these metrics serve as a common language for evaluating and validating the performance of each approach. This standardized evaluation framework is essential for advancing the field of video anomaly detection, driving the development of more accurate and reliable models that can effectively handle the complexities of real-world scenarios.\n\nGiven the discussion on the limitations of evaluation metrics in the following section, it is important to note that while AUC, precision-recall curves, and the F1-score provide valuable insights, they are not without shortcomings. For example, AUC assumes a balanced operating point, which may not always be reflective of real-world conditions where anomalies are typically rare. Similarly, precision-recall curves and the F1-score are sensitive to class imbalance, potentially leading to misleading evaluations if not properly adjusted for the specific context. Therefore, while these metrics are indispensable tools in the evaluation toolkit, they should be used in conjunction with domain-specific considerations and complementary metrics to provide a comprehensive assessment of model performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision-recall curves, and the F1-score are fundamental metrics for evaluating the performance of video anomaly detection models. These metrics not only provide a standardized framework for comparison and validation but also offer insights into the strengths and limitations of different approaches. By leveraging these metrics, researchers and practitioners can make informed decisions regarding model selection, optimization, and deployment, ultimately contributing to the advancement of video anomaly detection techniques in real-world applications.\n\n### 6.2 Limitations of Evaluation Metrics\n\nEvaluation metrics play a crucial role in assessing the performance of video anomaly detection models, providing a quantitative basis for comparison and improvement. However, despite their utility, these metrics face significant limitations, primarily stemming from their sensitivity to class imbalance, difficulty in handling imprecise ground truths, and the challenge of accurately reflecting the true cost of false positives and negatives in real-world scenarios.\n\nOne of the most significant limitations of common evaluation metrics such as AUC, precision-recall curves, and F1-score is their sensitivity to class imbalance. Video anomaly detection datasets typically comprise a vast majority of normal samples and a minority of anomalous samples. As highlighted in 'Generalized Video Anomaly Event Detection [3]', this class imbalance can skew evaluation results, making it challenging to accurately assess model performance. For instance, a model that consistently predicts every sample as normal would yield an AUC score close to 0.5, which fails to reflect its poor performance on the minority class of anomalies. Similarly, precision and recall metrics can be misleading; high recall might be achieved merely by predicting every sample as anomalous, while high precision could be attained by rarely predicting anything as anomalous, neither of which is practical.\n\nAnother limitation lies in handling imprecise ground truths. Ground truth labels are often subjective and can vary based on human interpretation, especially in complex video scenes where defining an anomaly can be ambiguous. For example, 'Video Anomaly Detection for Smart Surveillance [2]' notes that anomalies are broadly defined as unusual events or activities signifying irregular behavior. Determining what constitutes an anomaly can be challenging, particularly in the absence of clear guidelines. This subjectivity can lead to inconsistent labeling across datasets, affecting the reliability of evaluation metrics. In scenarios where anomalies are rare or poorly defined, creating accurate ground truth labels becomes even more problematic, further impacting the accuracy of evaluation metrics.\n\nMoreover, reflecting the true cost of false positives and negatives in real-world scenarios is another significant limitation. In many video anomaly detection applications, the consequences of false positives and false negatives can vary greatly. For instance, in a surveillance context, a false positive could lead to unnecessary alarm activations, causing inconvenience or anxiety, while a false negative could mean missing a critical anomaly, possibly leading to serious security breaches or safety hazards. 'Video Anomaly Detection for Smart Surveillance [2]' underscores the importance of balancing these costs. Traditional metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score do not inherently account for these varying costs, treating all misclassifications equally. Consequently, a model performing well according to these metrics might still incur unacceptable costs in real-world deployment.\n\nAdditionally, the reliance on a single threshold for anomaly detection can further complicate the interpretation of evaluation metrics. Many metrics assume a binary classification of samples as normal or anomalous based on a fixed threshold, which may not align with the continuous nature of anomaly scores. This can obscure the true performance of the model across different severity levels of anomalies. For instance, a model might excel at detecting severe anomalies but struggle with subtler ones, a scenario traditional metrics might overlook. Moreover, the optimal threshold for minimizing false positives and negatives can vary based on the application context, complicating the setting of a universal standard for evaluation.\n\nFurthermore, the lack of temporal context consideration in many evaluation metrics limits their effectiveness. Video anomaly detection models often aim to detect anomalies over time rather than at individual frames, necessitating metrics that can evaluate performance across sequences. However, many traditional metrics focus solely on frame-level predictions, potentially overlooking the importance of sequence-level coherence. For example, a model might correctly identify an anomaly at a specific frame but fail to maintain this detection across subsequent frames, a scenario frame-level metrics would miss. Metrics incorporating temporal information, such as sequence-level AUC or temporal precision-recall curves, are necessary to provide a more comprehensive assessment of model performance.\n\nLastly, evaluating unsupervised models poses additional challenges for traditional evaluation metrics. Many video anomaly detection models operate in unsupervised or weakly-supervised settings, relying on self-supervised or semi-supervised learning paradigms. These models do not require explicit anomaly labels during training, making it challenging to evaluate them using metrics designed for supervised settings. As discussed in 'Deep Video Anomaly Detection: Opportunities and Challenges [1]', unsupervised models often rely on reconstruction errors or similarity measures to identify anomalies, complicating the direct application of traditional classification-based metrics. Novel evaluation methods accounting for these differences are required to fairly assess the performance of unsupervised models.\n\nIn summary, while evaluation metrics are indispensable tools for assessing video anomaly detection models, they come with several limitations. Addressing these limitations requires careful consideration of the specific application context, the nature of the anomalies being detected, and the availability of high-quality ground truth labels. Developing more sophisticated and context-aware evaluation metrics will be crucial for advancing the field of video anomaly detection and ensuring models perform effectively in real-world scenarios.\n\n### 6.3 Challenges in Evaluating Different Models\n\nEvaluating and comparing models in the field of video anomaly detection is fraught with challenges that stem from the variability in experimental settings, the complexity of defining anomalies, and the impact of dataset characteristics on model performance. These issues collectively pose significant barriers to achieving a unified and fair assessment of model effectiveness.\n\nFirstly, the variability in experimental settings presents a substantial hurdle. Differences in hardware configurations, software environments, and implementation details can significantly affect the outcomes of model evaluations. For instance, the performance of deep learning models can vary depending on the choice of optimization algorithms, hyperparameter settings, and even the random initialization of weights. Furthermore, the use of different libraries and frameworks can introduce subtle biases that skew the results. These variations make it difficult to draw direct comparisons between models developed under different conditions. The lack of standardized evaluation procedures exacerbates this issue, leading to inconsistent reporting of results and making it challenging to establish a clear benchmark for performance. To address this, researchers should strive to standardize their evaluation protocols, ensuring that all models are assessed under similar conditions to facilitate a fair and meaningful comparison.\n\nSecondly, the complexity of defining anomalies poses another layer of challenge. Unlike traditional classification tasks where the boundaries between classes are well-defined, anomaly detection involves identifying rare and often unpredictable events that deviate from normal behavior. Defining what constitutes an anomaly can be subjective and context-dependent, making it difficult to create universally accepted ground truth labels. Additionally, the nature of anomalies can vary widely across different application domains, ranging from abrupt changes in surveillance footage to subtle deviations in industrial processes. The absence of a consistent definition for anomalies means that models evaluated on one dataset might perform poorly on another, even if they exhibit similar characteristics. The heterogeneity of anomalies complicates the evaluation process and necessitates a nuanced approach to label creation and verification. Researchers must carefully consider the specific context and application domain when designing experiments to ensure that anomalies are defined and labeled appropriately.\n\nThirdly, the characteristics of the datasets used for evaluation play a crucial role in determining model performance. The choice of dataset can have a profound impact on the evaluation outcomes, as different datasets contain varying levels of complexity, noise, and diversity. Large-scale datasets like the Large-Scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database and the CHAD dataset offer a rich source of data for training and testing models, but their sheer size and diversity can introduce additional complexities. Smaller datasets, on the other hand, may not capture the full spectrum of normal and anomalous behaviors, potentially leading to biased or overly optimistic performance estimates. The presence of class imbalance, where normal sequences vastly outnumber anomalies, can further complicate the evaluation process, as models may be biased towards predicting the majority class. Moreover, the quality of annotations in the dataset, including the granularity and consistency of labels, directly affects the reliability of the evaluation metrics. Researchers must pay close attention to these factors when selecting and preparing datasets for evaluation, ensuring that the chosen datasets adequately represent the target application domain and provide a robust basis for assessing model performance.\n\nIn addition to these challenges, the evolving nature of deep learning models introduces further complexities. The rapid pace of innovation in deep learning, driven by advancements in architectures, training techniques, and optimization methods, means that new models are continually being developed and refined. Keeping up with these developments is challenging, as it requires a constant reassessment of existing models and evaluation frameworks. The emergence of new models often necessitates the development of new evaluation paradigms and metrics, further complicating the evaluation landscape. Researchers must remain vigilant and adaptable, continuously updating their evaluation methods to ensure that they remain relevant and effective in assessing the performance of the latest models.\n\nAnother critical aspect is the interpretability of models, which plays a vital role in evaluating their effectiveness. While deep learning models excel at recognizing complex patterns in data, their opaque nature often makes it difficult to understand the underlying mechanisms driving their decisions. This opacity can be problematic when it comes to evaluating the robustness and reliability of anomaly detection models, as it becomes challenging to ascertain whether the model is genuinely identifying anomalies or simply exploiting spurious correlations in the data. The lack of interpretability can also hinder efforts to debug and improve models, as it is difficult to pinpoint the source of errors or misclassifications. To mitigate these issues, researchers should prioritize the development of more transparent and interpretable models, employing techniques such as attention mechanisms, saliency maps, and other visualization tools to provide insights into the decision-making process.\n\nFinally, the computational resources required for evaluating deep learning models pose logistical challenges. Training and testing deep learning models can be computationally intensive, often requiring powerful hardware and substantial computing resources. The increasing complexity of models, coupled with the need for large-scale datasets, has led to a growing demand for high-performance computing infrastructure. Access to such resources can be a limiting factor for researchers, particularly those working in academic or resource-constrained settings. Moreover, the energy consumption associated with running deep learning models is a concern, given the environmental and economic implications of high-power computing. Balancing the need for accurate and reliable evaluations with the practical constraints of resource availability is a significant challenge that researchers must navigate carefully.\n\nIn conclusion, the challenges associated with evaluating and comparing models in the field of video anomaly detection are multifaceted and interconnected. Overcoming these challenges requires a concerted effort from the research community to develop more rigorous and standardized evaluation methods, define anomalies consistently, select appropriate datasets, and address the interpretability and computational demands of deep learning models. By tackling these challenges head-on, researchers can pave the way for more reliable and meaningful assessments of model performance, ultimately driving progress and innovation in the field of video anomaly detection.\n\n### 6.4 Significance of Dataset Choice\n\nThe choice of appropriate datasets is paramount in the evaluation and validation of video anomaly detection models. Selecting a dataset that closely mirrors the specific requirements of the application domain ensures that the model's performance is not just measured under controlled laboratory conditions but is also tested against real-world complexities and challenges. This subsection explores the importance of dataset selection, focusing on factors such as scale, diversity, and relevance to real-world conditions.\n\nFirstly, the scale of a dataset is crucial as it directly impacts the model's ability to generalize from the training phase to unseen data during testing. Larger datasets allow the model to encounter a broader spectrum of scenarios and behaviors, thereby enhancing its robustness and adaptability. For instance, the Large-Scale Anomaly Detection (LAD) database stands out for its comprehensive coverage, encompassing a vast array of video sequences and anomaly categories. Such extensive datasets provide the necessary volume of data to train deep learning models effectively, ensuring that they can handle a wide range of potential anomalies. In contrast, smaller datasets might lead to overfitting, where the model performs exceptionally well on the training data but fails to generalize to new, unseen data. Therefore, the scale of the dataset plays a critical role in determining the model\u2019s overall performance and reliability.\n\nSecondly, diversity within a dataset is another pivotal factor that significantly influences the model's performance. Diversity ensures that the model encounters a wide variety of anomalies and normal behaviors, which is essential for building a comprehensive understanding of the data distribution. This is particularly important because anomalies can vary greatly depending on the context and environment. For example, the CHAD dataset offers a high-resolution, multi-camera setting that captures diverse anomaly types, such as pedestrian collisions, erratic driving, and unusual behaviors. By incorporating such varied and rich data, the model can better learn to differentiate between normal and abnormal behaviors, enhancing its detection accuracy. Furthermore, diversity helps in mitigating the risks associated with concept drift, where the statistical properties of the data change over time, leading to decreased model performance. Thus, a diverse dataset contributes to the development of more resilient and adaptable models capable of handling evolving data distributions.\n\nThirdly, the relevance of a dataset to real-world conditions is a critical aspect that cannot be overlooked. Real-world conditions often involve complexities such as variable lighting, occlusions, and environmental changes, which can significantly affect the model's performance. Ensuring that the dataset includes realistic and context-specific scenarios allows the model to be evaluated in conditions that closely mirror actual deployment settings. For instance, the CHAD dataset includes detailed annotations like bounding boxes and identities, facilitating more precise and contextually relevant anomaly detection. By aligning the dataset characteristics with real-world conditions, researchers can gain a more accurate understanding of the model's strengths and weaknesses, ultimately guiding the development of more effective anomaly detection systems.\n\nMoreover, the choice of an appropriate dataset is crucial for addressing the limitations and challenges inherent in video anomaly detection. Traditional methods often struggle with computational inefficiency, difficulty in handling dynamic scenes, and the need for extensive manual intervention. Deep learning approaches offer promising solutions to these challenges, but their success largely depends on the quality and relevance of the training data. For instance, the Grid HTM model, which leverages the Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) algorithm, demonstrates significant improvements in handling noise and performing online learning. However, the effectiveness of such models in real-world scenarios is highly dependent on the dataset's ability to capture the nuances and complexities of real-world anomalies. Similarly, the Video Anomaly Detection Using Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Nets and Context Mining approach emphasizes the importance of deriving contextual properties from high-level features to enhance detection accuracy. This underscores the need for datasets that not only provide a broad range of anomalies but also include contextual information that aids in distinguishing between normal and anomalous behaviors.\n\nFurthermore, the selection of an appropriate dataset is essential for evaluating the model's performance across different evaluation metrics. Commonly used metrics such as the Area Under the Curve (AUC), precision-recall curves, and F1-score play a critical role in assessing the model's effectiveness. However, the performance measured through these metrics can vary significantly depending on the characteristics of the dataset. For example, a dataset with imbalanced classes or ambiguous ground truths can skew the evaluation results, making it difficult to draw meaningful conclusions about the model's true performance. Therefore, choosing a dataset that accurately reflects the real-world conditions and challenges is essential for obtaining reliable and valid performance metrics. This ensures that the model's performance is not only measured against a broad spectrum of anomalies but also validated under realistic and diverse conditions, thereby enhancing its applicability in real-world deployments.\n\nLastly, the relevance of the dataset to the specific application domain is a crucial consideration that can significantly influence the model's performance and practical utility. For instance, in surveillance applications, the model's ability to detect anomalies in crowded and dynamic environments is of paramount importance. The CHAD dataset, with its multi-camera setup and detailed annotations, provides an excellent platform for evaluating such models in realistic surveillance scenarios. By aligning the dataset characteristics with the specific requirements of the application domain, researchers can develop models that are finely tuned to address the unique challenges and demands of the target application. This not only enhances the model's practical utility but also ensures that the evaluation results are directly applicable and actionable in real-world deployments.\n\nIn conclusion, the selection of an appropriate dataset is a critical step in the development and evaluation of video anomaly detection models. Factors such as scale, diversity, and relevance to real-world conditions play a pivotal role in shaping the model's performance and reliability. By carefully curating datasets that closely reflect the specific requirements of the application domain, researchers can ensure that their models are not only theoretically sound but also practically effective in real-world deployments. This holistic approach to dataset selection lays the foundation for developing robust, adaptable, and contextually relevant anomaly detection systems capable of addressing the diverse challenges encountered in modern surveillance and monitoring applications.\n\n## 7 Applications and Case Studies\n\n### 7.1 Real-Time Anomaly Detection on Resource-Constrained Devices\n\nDeploying deep learning-based anomaly detection systems on resource-constrained devices is a critical challenge in modern surveillance and monitoring applications. The aim is to achieve real-time performance and maintain efficient data transmission, ensuring that the systems can operate effectively in environments with limited computational resources and bandwidth constraints. This section delves into the advancements and challenges associated with deploying deep learning models on such devices, focusing on balancing performance and resource utilization.\n\nOptimizing model architecture and computational efficiency is a key consideration in deploying deep learning models on devices with limited resources. Traditionally, deep learning models used in video anomaly detection are computationally intensive, requiring substantial computational power and memory. However, advancements in model compression techniques and the development of specialized hardware such as GPUs and TPUs have facilitated the deployment of deep learning models on resource-constrained devices. For instance, models like the Spatio-Temporal Auto-Transformer Encoder (STATE) and the Grid Hierarchical Temporal Memory (Grid HTM) [3] demonstrate promising results in terms of both performance and resource utilization. These models incorporate innovative architectural designs that enable efficient processing of spatiotemporal data, making them suitable for deployment on devices with constrained resources.\n\nReal-time performance is another critical aspect of deploying deep learning-based anomaly detection systems on resource-constrained devices. Ensuring that the system can process video streams in real-time is essential for timely detection of anomalies, which is crucial in applications such as surveillance and monitoring. To achieve real-time performance, researchers have explored various strategies, including model quantization, pruning, and the use of lightweight architectures. For example, the work in 'A Lightweight Video Anomaly Detection Model with Weak Supervision and Adaptive Instance Selection' [18] introduces a lightweight video anomaly detection model designed to run efficiently on resource-limited devices. This model employs an adaptive instance selection strategy and a lightweight multi-level temporal correlation attention module to reduce computational overhead while maintaining high detection accuracy. Such innovations are vital for achieving real-time performance in real-world applications.\n\nEfficient data transmission is another significant factor affecting the deployment of deep learning-based anomaly detection systems on resource-constrained devices. In surveillance and monitoring applications, data transmission can consume a considerable amount of bandwidth, especially when dealing with high-resolution video streams. To mitigate this issue, researchers have focused on optimizing the data transmission process, including the use of lossy compression techniques and selective transmission of anomaly-related data. For instance, the TeD-SPAD framework [6] proposes a method for destroying visual private information in a self-supervised manner, which can also contribute to more efficient data transmission. By emphasizing temporally discriminative features, TeD-SPAD reduces the amount of data transmitted while preserving necessary information for anomaly detection.\n\nAddressing challenges related to data quality is also crucial for the successful deployment of deep learning-based anomaly detection systems on resource-constrained devices. Many real-world scenarios require surveillance systems to operate in environments with varying levels of data quality, including issues such as occlusions, poor lighting, and motion blur. Robust models that can handle noisy and incomplete data are essential. For example, the Grid HTM model [3] demonstrates strong performance in handling noise and performing online learning, making it suitable for real-world applications where data quality can vary significantly. Additionally, integrating memory modules in deep learning models, as discussed in Section 5, can further enhance the system\u2019s ability to handle noisy data by providing a mechanism for storing and recalling normal patterns.\n\nPrivacy and security concerns are also prevalent in the deployment of deep learning-based anomaly detection systems on resource-constrained devices. In surveillance applications, it is imperative to ensure that the system does not inadvertently leak sensitive information. Recent advancements in privacy-preserving techniques, such as the TeD-SPAD framework, address this concern by promoting temporally discriminative features that destroy visual private information. These techniques not only enhance privacy but also contribute to more efficient data transmission, thereby addressing the dual challenges of privacy and data efficiency.\n\nIn conclusion, deploying deep learning-based anomaly detection systems on resource-constrained devices requires a careful balance between computational efficiency, real-time performance, and data transmission efficiency. Advances in model architecture, data transmission optimization, and privacy-preserving techniques have enabled the development of robust and efficient systems suitable for deployment in resource-limited environments. However, continued research is necessary to address ongoing challenges, such as handling noisy data and ensuring privacy, to fully realize the potential of deep learning in real-world applications.\n\n### 7.2 Customized Deep Learning for Surveillance Applications\n\nCustomized deep learning models designed for specific surveillance needs represent a crucial advancement in the field of video anomaly detection. These models are optimized for particular surveillance environments, offering improved accuracy through data-driven training and the efficient use of resources. Surveillance systems, whether deployed in urban centers, industrial complexes, or healthcare facilities, face unique challenges that necessitate tailored solutions. Building upon the advancements in computational efficiency and real-time performance discussed in the previous section, this section explores how customized models can further enhance the capabilities of deep learning-based anomaly detection systems.\n\n**Design Principles**\n\nCustomized deep learning models for surveillance applications are often designed with a deep understanding of the specific operational environments in which they will be deployed. For instance, surveillance systems in urban areas require models capable of detecting a wide range of behaviors and activities, from pedestrian movements to vehicular traffic. Conversely, industrial surveillance might focus on monitoring machinery and personnel, where anomalies could indicate equipment malfunctions or unsafe working conditions. These varying contexts demand specialized models that can accurately discern between normal and anomalous behaviors within the specific surveillance settings.\n\nOne approach to customization is the incorporation of domain-specific knowledge into the model architecture and training process. For example, models trained for surveillance in public spaces might leverage prior knowledge about typical human activities and behaviors. Similarly, industrial models could benefit from incorporating information about standard operating procedures and equipment usage patterns. Such domain-aware models can significantly enhance the detection accuracy by reducing false positives and negatives, thereby improving the overall reliability of the surveillance system.\n\n**Training Processes**\n\nData-driven training is a cornerstone of customized deep learning models. These models often require extensive datasets that reflect the operational conditions of the surveillance environment. Training such models typically involves collecting and annotating a vast amount of video data that captures both normal and anomalous scenarios. The annotation process is critical, as it ensures that the model can effectively learn to distinguish between typical and atypical behaviors.\n\nMoreover, the training process may involve the use of semi-supervised or unsupervised learning techniques to handle the limited availability of labeled data. Semi-supervised approaches, as discussed in 'Generalized Video Anomaly Event Detection: Systematic Taxonomy and Comparison of Deep Models', allow the model to leverage unlabeled data, thereby expanding the scope of learning beyond the confines of a smaller, labeled dataset. This approach is particularly advantageous in surveillance applications, where labeling every possible scenario can be prohibitively time-consuming and resource-intensive.\n\nUnsupervised learning techniques, on the other hand, offer a flexible solution for scenarios where labeled data is scarce. For instance, the use of self-supervised learning strategies like Mix-up and MOCA, as mentioned in 'Deep Video Anomaly Detection: Opportunities and Challenges', allows the model to learn from the structure of the data itself. By creating synthetic anomalies through data augmentation, these techniques enable the model to develop a robust understanding of what constitutes normal behavior, thus facilitating the identification of deviations.\n\n**Deployment Strategies**\n\nDeploying customized deep learning models in real-world surveillance environments requires careful consideration of computational constraints and real-time processing demands. Surveillance systems often operate on edge devices with limited computing power, necessitating models that are both efficient and accurate. Optimizing model architecture for reduced computational complexity is paramount. One strategy to achieve this is through model compression and pruning, which reduce the model size without significantly compromising performance. Another approach is to deploy models that are inherently lightweight, such as those based on convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with fewer parameters. For example, the HMOF feature extraction method described in 'Real-Time Anomaly Detection With HMOF Feature' offers a computationally efficient solution for motion detection in surveillance videos. By leveraging features that are sensitive to motion magnitudes, this method provides a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency.\n\nMoreover, the deployment of customized models should prioritize real-time performance to ensure timely detection and response to anomalies. Real-time anomaly detection is particularly critical in surveillance applications where immediate alerts are necessary for quick intervention. Models designed for real-time deployment must be optimized for speed without sacrificing detection accuracy. Techniques such as batch normalization and efficient layer operations can significantly enhance the performance of models in real-time applications.\n\n**Improvements in Accuracy**\n\nCustomized deep learning models for surveillance applications demonstrate substantial improvements in detection accuracy compared to generic models. The incorporation of domain-specific knowledge, combined with data-driven training, enables these models to achieve higher precision and recall rates. For instance, the novel approach combining human skeletal frameworks with video data analysis techniques, as described in 'Divide and Conquer in Video Anomaly Detection: A Comprehensive Review and New Approach', achieved state-of-the-art performance on the ShanghaiTech dataset.\n\nThe ability to refine anomaly scores through advanced scoring mechanisms also contributes to improved accuracy. Techniques such as cross-branch feed-forward networks, as discussed in 'Making Reconstruction-based Method Great Again for Video Anomaly Detection', integrate multiple streams of information to enhance the accuracy of anomaly detection. By leveraging both spatial and temporal information, these models can provide more reliable and precise anomaly scores, thereby reducing false alarms and missed detections.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nCustomized deep learning models for surveillance applications represent a significant advancement in the field of video anomaly detection. Through the integration of domain-specific knowledge, data-driven training, and efficient deployment strategies, these models offer improved accuracy and real-time performance. These advancements complement the strategies discussed in the previous section, such as model compression and real-time processing, by tailoring the models to specific surveillance needs. As surveillance systems continue to evolve, the development of customized models will remain a critical area of research, driving the adoption of more intelligent and responsive surveillance solutions.\n\n### 7.3 Memory-Efficient Anomaly Detection for IIoT\n\nDeploying deep learning models for video anomaly detection in industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) environments presents unique challenges due to the constrained memory resources typical of edge devices. Robust anomaly detection is essential for ensuring operational safety and efficiency in industrial settings, but deep learning models often require significant computational and storage resources, which exceed the capabilities of these devices. To address this, researchers have developed various strategies aimed at reducing the size of deep learning models and minimizing peak memory usage, thereby enabling more efficient deployment on IIoT devices.\n\nOne common approach to achieving memory efficiency is through model pruning, a technique that removes redundant parameters or connections from a neural network, reducing its size and computational overhead without significantly compromising performance. Aggressive pruning can lead to substantial reductions in model size, making it possible to deploy deep learning models on devices with limited memory. Quantization, another technique, involves converting the weights and activations of a model from floating-point numbers to lower precision formats, such as integers or fixed-point numbers, which reduces the memory footprint and accelerates inference times, making it suitable for deployment on memory-constrained IIoT devices.\n\nKnowledge distillation is another strategy that leverages a larger, more accurate teacher model to train a smaller student model, transferring the knowledge from the teacher to the student. This approach allows for the creation of compact student models that retain the performance of larger models, making them ideal for deployment on edge devices with limited memory resources. Combining knowledge distillation with other techniques, such as quantization and pruning, can further reduce the size of the student model, leading to greater memory savings.\n\nSpecialized hardware acceleration, including the use of Graphical Processing Units (GPUs) and Field-Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), can also enhance the efficiency of deep learning models in IIoT environments. GPUs are well-suited for parallel processing tasks common in deep learning, while FPGAs offer programmability for customizing hardware to specific tasks, thereby reducing the memory load on the device. These specialized hardware solutions make it feasible to deploy deep learning models for video anomaly detection on IIoT devices without overwhelming their memory resources.\n\nCompact deep learning architectures, such as MobileNet and ShuffleNet, have been developed to balance computational efficiency with accuracy, making them well-suited for resource-constrained environments. These architectures use techniques like depthwise separable convolutions, which reduce the number of parameters and computational requirements. Additionally, the use of efficient neural network layers, such as ConvLSTM for capturing temporal dependencies, enhances the performance of anomaly detection models while maintaining a low memory footprint.\n\nDynamic memory allocation strategies are also crucial for managing memory usage during runtime. Techniques such as memory pooling, where memory is allocated and released based on the model\u2019s needs, can optimize memory usage. Streaming architectures, where data is processed in chunks rather than being fully loaded into memory, can further reduce the memory footprint during inference.\n\nTransfer learning, involving the initialization of smaller models with pre-trained models on large datasets followed by fine-tuning on smaller, task-specific datasets, is another approach that reduces the amount of training data and computational resources needed. This method enables smaller models to achieve high accuracy with minimal training data, thereby reducing memory requirements for both training and inference.\n\nIn conclusion, deploying deep learning models for video anomaly detection in IIoT environments requires a multifaceted approach that includes model compression techniques, specialized hardware acceleration, and efficient architectural designs. By employing these strategies, it is possible to create memory-efficient anomaly detection models that perform effectively on edge devices with limited resources. Further optimization of memory usage and development of novel techniques for enhancing performance on constrained devices will continue to advance the deployment of deep learning models in industrial IoT applications.\n\n### 7.4 Probabilistic Approaches for Video Anomaly Detection\n\nProbabilistic approaches for video anomaly detection leverage the inherent uncertainty in video data to estimate the likelihood of different video representations, thereby providing a robust framework for identifying anomalies. By incorporating probabilistic reasoning, these models can effectively handle the complexities and ambiguities present in video sequences, making them particularly effective in challenging datasets. \n\nOne notable probabilistic approach involves the use of generative models, which aim to learn the probability distribution of normal video data. These models can generate new samples that resemble the normal data, facilitating the identification of outliers that do not conform to the learned distribution. For instance, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have been employed to learn the distribution of normal video sequences, allowing for the detection of anomalies through the reconstruction error. However, GANs can encounter issues such as mode collapse and instability during training, which can impact the quality of the generated samples and subsequently the accuracy of anomaly detection.\n\nAnother probabilistic method employs Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models (HMMs), which have been extensively studied for anomaly detection in time-series data. In the context of video anomaly detection, these models can be adapted to capture the temporal dependencies within video sequences. For example, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) can model the transition probabilities between different states in a video sequence, enabling the identification of abnormal transitions that deviate from the expected behavior. Despite their effectiveness, HMMs require meticulous parameter tuning and may struggle with capturing long-term dependencies, which are essential for complex video sequences.\n\nRecent developments in deep learning have led to the creation of probabilistic deep learning models, such as variational autoencoders (VAEs) and probabilistic autoencoders (PAEs). These models integrate probabilistic reasoning into the framework of autoencoders. VAEs learn a latent space that captures the variability in normal video data, and by sampling from this latent space, the model can generate new video samples. Anomalies can be detected based on the reconstruction error or the divergence from the learned latent distribution. This approach has been successfully applied in video anomaly detection. PAEs extend VAEs by introducing additional constraints on the latent space to encourage a more structured and meaningful representation of video data. This leads to improved anomaly detection performance by better capturing the underlying structure of normal video sequences.\n\nDeep probabilistic models have also been combined with recurrent neural networks (RNNs) and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks to address the sequential nature of video data. These models can effectively capture temporal dependencies and perform anomaly detection by analyzing the deviation from the learned normal behavior over time. For example, the integration of LSTM networks with probabilistic models has been shown to enhance the robustness of anomaly detection systems in dealing with noisy and complex video sequences. However, this combination can increase computational complexity, posing challenges for real-time anomaly detection applications.\n\nAttention mechanisms have been incorporated into deep probabilistic models to improve their interpretability and accuracy. These mechanisms allow the model to focus on relevant parts of the input video sequence, refining the anomaly scores during testing. For instance, the Spatio-Temporal Attention Trans-Encoder (STATE) model integrates a learnable convolutional attention mechanism that efficiently captures temporal dependencies and improves anomaly detection performance. This approach has demonstrated superior performance on challenging video anomaly detection datasets, highlighting the benefits of combining attention mechanisms with deep probabilistic models.\n\nMoreover, probabilistic approaches have been extended to incorporate multimodal inputs, such as visual and audio signals, for anomaly detection. This can provide additional context and improve the robustness of the anomaly detection system. For example, combining visual and acoustic data can help distinguish between normal and anomalous events in scenarios where visual cues alone may be insufficient. However, developing multimodal probabilistic models that effectively fuse and reason about multiple modalities can be computationally intensive and pose challenges for real-time deployment.\n\nThere has also been growing interest in the application of deep probabilistic models for semi-supervised and unsupervised anomaly detection. Semi-supervised approaches leverage a small amount of labeled data to guide the learning process, enhancing the generalizability and robustness of the model. Unsupervised methods, relying solely on unlabeled data, are particularly appealing when labeled data is scarce or expensive to obtain. These approaches have achieved promising results on challenging datasets, although they may face challenges in accurately modeling the distribution of normal data, potentially affecting the performance of anomaly detection.\n\nIn summary, probabilistic approaches offer a promising avenue for advancing video anomaly detection by incorporating uncertainty and leveraging the inherent structure of video data. These models can effectively handle the complexities and ambiguities present in video sequences, making them particularly suitable for challenging datasets. As research in this area progresses, we can anticipate further advancements in the development of deep probabilistic models for video anomaly detection, leading to improved accuracy and robustness in real-world applications.\n\n### 7.5 HTM-Based Anomaly Detection in Complex Videos\n\nThe advent of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) models has introduced a novel approach to anomaly detection in complex video streams, offering a promising alternative to traditional deep learning techniques. Specifically, the Grid HTM architecture represents a significant advancement in this domain, particularly in the context of surveillance video analysis. This subsection explores the Grid HTM model in detail, discussing its architecture, operational principles, and the distinct advantages it offers over conventional deep learning models.\n\n### Integration of HTM Paradigm with Spatial and Temporal Grid Structures\n\nThe Grid HTM architecture combines the HTM paradigm with spatial and temporal grid structures to effectively model the spatiotemporal dynamics inherent in complex video sequences. Central to this model is its hierarchical nature, which facilitates the learning of invariant representations of video content, enhancing the detection of anomalies that deviate from these learned norms.\n\nAt the core of the Grid HTM model is a multi-layer architecture, each layer dedicated to capturing different levels of abstraction in the video data. Raw pixel values are initially processed through a series of spatial filters at the base layer to extract local spatial features. These features are then passed through temporal filters to capture the evolving patterns over time. Higher layers abstract these spatial-temporal features into more generalized forms, allowing the model to identify complex patterns indicative of normal behavior. This hierarchical processing culminates in a robust representation of the video content that can be utilized for anomaly detection.\n\nThe Grid HTM innovatively uses grid structures to integrate spatial and temporal information. Each cell in the spatial grid corresponds to a region of interest in the video frame, while the temporal grid captures the dynamics of these regions over time. The interaction between these grids enables the model to learn how spatial features evolve temporally, providing a rich representation essential for detecting anomalies in complex video streams.\n\n### Operational Mechanisms and Online Learning Capabilities\n\nThe Grid HTM model operates by learning and predicting normal spatiotemporal patterns in video data during the training phase. This learned representation serves as the basis for anomaly detection, with deviations from the predicted patterns flagged as potential anomalies. In operation, the model continuously processes video frames, updating its internal state based on the observed data. Significant deviations trigger anomaly alerts, facilitated by the hierarchical structure of HTMs that can handle a broad range of temporal scales.\n\nA key strength of the Grid HTM model is its capacity for online learning, which allows it to adapt to changes in the video environment over time. This is especially beneficial in dynamic surveillance scenarios where background and foreground activities vary, necessitating continuous updates to the model's understanding of normal behavior. The online learning feature ensures the model remains effective even in evolving environments, a notable advantage over traditional deep learning models requiring periodic retraining with new data.\n\n### Advantages Over Traditional Deep Learning Approaches\n\nThe Grid HTM model offers several advantages over traditional deep learning methods for video anomaly detection. Firstly, it handles noise and outliers more effectively, a common challenge for traditional models that can degrade performance in real-world scenarios. The hierarchical structure and grid-based representation of the Grid HTM make it more resilient to noise by filtering out irrelevant information and focusing on underlying patterns of normal behavior.\n\nSecondly, the Grid HTM provides enhanced interpretability. Unlike black-box deep learning models, which are difficult to interpret and debug, the Grid HTM's hierarchical structure allows for a transparent understanding of its anomaly detections. Researchers and practitioners can examine learned representations at various levels of abstraction, crucial for building trust in anomaly detection systems in critical applications like surveillance and security.\n\nLastly, the Grid HTM demonstrates superior performance in handling complex video streams, especially those with dynamic backgrounds and foreground activities. Traditional models often demand extensive data preprocessing and fine-tuning to perform well on such datasets, whereas the Grid HTM\u2019s ability to learn robust spatiotemporal representations without extensive preprocessing makes it a more flexible and scalable solution.\n\n### Application in Surveillance Footage\n\nThe Grid HTM model shows particular promise in surveillance footage, where accurate and timely anomaly detection is critical. Challenges such as varying lighting conditions, occlusions, and complex background activities can complicate anomaly detection, but the Grid HTM\u2019s robust spatiotemporal representation and online learning capabilities make it well-suited for surveillance applications.\n\nIn practice, the Grid HTM has been applied to detect various anomalies in surveillance footage, including unauthorized access, loitering, and sudden movements. Performance evaluations using standard benchmark datasets like UCF-Crime and TAD demonstrate its effectiveness in identifying anomalies missed by traditional models. For instance, the Grid HTM achieved a significant improvement in anomaly detection accuracy compared to traditional deep learning models in the TAD dataset, showcasing its potential in real-world surveillance scenarios.\n\nMoreover, the Grid HTM\u2019s online learning capability ensures sustained performance in changing surveillance environments, maintaining the integrity of surveillance systems over extended periods. This adaptability is vital for addressing emerging anomalies, ensuring reliable and continuous surveillance.\n\nIn summary, the Grid HTM model represents a significant advancement in video anomaly detection, offering a robust and interpretable alternative to traditional deep learning approaches. Its unique combination of hierarchical temporal modeling, grid-based representation, and online learning capabilities makes it well-suited for handling the complexities of surveillance footage and other dynamic video streams.\n\n### 7.6 Semi-Supervised Video Anomaly Detection Methods\n\nSemi-supervised video anomaly detection methods aim to leverage both labeled and unlabeled data to improve detection accuracy while addressing the limitation of having limited labeled data. These methods typically involve pre-training on large unlabeled datasets to learn generalizable features before fine-tuning with a smaller set of labeled data. This approach not only reduces reliance on labeled data but also enhances the model's ability to generalize to unseen anomalies.\n\nOne pioneering work in this domain is the research conducted by [25]. This study introduces a deep multiple instance ranking framework to learn anomalies from both normal and anomalous videos. The authors propose treating normal and anomalous videos as bags and video segments as instances in multiple instance learning (MIL). Through this framework, the model can predict high anomaly scores for anomalous video segments, facilitating the identification of abnormal events without the need for explicit clip-level annotations. This approach is particularly valuable in real-world surveillance scenarios where obtaining precise segment-level labels can be extremely time-consuming and labor-intensive.\n\nAdditionally, semi-supervised approaches have shown promise in integrating context mining and feature extraction techniques to enhance anomaly detection accuracy. For example, [11] demonstrates the utility of using pre-trained deep convolutional neural nets for feature extraction followed by context mining to refine anomaly detection. By leveraging pre-trained models, the method significantly reduces computational complexity, making it suitable for resource-constrained devices such as edge devices in IoT setups. This work highlights the effectiveness of combining pre-trained models with context mining strategies to achieve robust anomaly detection performance with relatively low model complexity.\n\nAnother notable direction in semi-supervised video anomaly detection involves the integration of spatiotemporal locality-aware mechanisms. The paper titled [26] introduces a novel approach that considers spatiotemporal tubes rather than whole-frame video segments for anomaly detection. This method enriches surveillance videos with spatial and temporal annotations, marking the first dataset for anomaly detection with bounding box supervision in both the training and test sets. Experimental results indicate that networks trained with spatiotemporal tubes exhibit superior performance compared to those trained on whole-frame videos. Furthermore, the model's ability to provide spatiotemporal proposals for unseen surveillance videos based solely on video-level labels underscores the robustness of the spatiotemporal locality approach. This capability not only enhances the precision of anomaly detection but also minimizes the dependency on human labeling, which is costly and time-consuming.\n\nSemi-supervised anomaly detection methods have also explored the use of pretext tasks to augment the training process with additional supervisory signals. For instance, the work presented in [27] introduces the Anomaly-Led Alignment Network (ALAN) for video anomaly retrieval. ALAN employs an anomaly-led sampling strategy to focus on key segments within long untrimmed videos. Subsequently, an efficient pretext task is designed to strengthen the semantic associations between video-text fine-grained representations. This method leverages two complementary alignments to further align cross-modal contents, enhancing the model's ability to understand and retrieve anomalous events accurately. The use of pretext tasks in semi-supervised learning frameworks not only improves the model's interpretability but also enhances its performance on downstream tasks.\n\nMoreover, recent advancements have integrated generative adversarial networks (GANs) and autoencoders into semi-supervised anomaly detection frameworks. For example, the study \"Video Anomaly Detection using GAN\" proposes a GAN-based approach that learns to reconstruct normal patterns in video sequences, identifying anomalies through reconstruction errors. Similarly, \"Visual anomaly detection in video by variational autoencoder\" explores the use of variational autoencoders for anomaly detection, emphasizing the role of these models in learning compact representations of normal video patterns. These generative models are particularly advantageous in semi-supervised settings as they can utilize vast amounts of unlabeled data to refine their understanding of normal behavior, subsequently improving their ability to detect anomalies.\n\nIn the realm of unsupervised learning, the paper \"Efficient GAN-Based Anomaly Detection\" introduces an efficient variant of GANs tailored for video anomaly detection. This model focuses on optimizing the reconstruction error to minimize the deviation from normal behavior, thus enhancing the detection of anomalies. Additionally, the work \"Making Reconstruction-based Method Great Again for Video Anomaly Detection\" presents a Spatio-Temporal Attention Trans-Encoder (STATE) model that integrates a learnable convolutional attention mechanism for efficient temporal learning. This model also incorporates a reconstruction-based input perturbation technique during testing, further refining the anomaly scoring process.\n\nThese semi-supervised approaches offer several advantages over purely supervised or unsupervised methods. By leveraging the abundance of unlabeled data alongside a smaller set of labeled examples, semi-supervised models can learn more robust and generalized representations. Furthermore, these models can adapt to the specific characteristics of surveillance footage, improving their performance in real-world applications. However, balancing the use of unlabeled data with ensuring accurate anomaly detection remains a critical issue. Additionally, designing effective pretext tasks and integrating context mining strategies requires careful consideration to avoid introducing biases or inaccuracies.\n\nIn conclusion, semi-supervised video anomaly detection methods represent a promising avenue for improving detection accuracy while mitigating reliance on extensive labeled data. By combining pre-trained models, context mining, and locality-aware mechanisms, these approaches have demonstrated significant advancements in addressing the challenges inherent in video anomaly detection. As the field continues to evolve, future research should focus on refining these methodologies to enhance their robustness, scalability, and adaptability to diverse real-world scenarios.\n\n## 8 Future Directions and Conclusions\n\n### 8.1 Current Advancements in Deep Learning for Video Anomaly Detection\n\nIn recent years, significant advancements have been made in the field of deep learning for video anomaly detection, particularly in model architectures and feature extraction techniques. Notable among these advancements are the Spatio-Temporal Auto-Transformer Encoder (STATE) and the Grid Hierarchical Temporal Memory (Grid HTM) model, which offer enhanced capabilities in anomaly detection across diverse applications. Additionally, improvements in feature extraction and representation learning have further refined the detection process, enabling more accurate and efficient identification of anomalies in video sequences.\n\nOne of the key advancements is the development of the STATE model, which integrates spatio-temporal attention mechanisms and learnable convolutional attention for efficient temporal learning [3]. This model introduces a reconstruction-based input perturbation technique during testing, enhancing its ability to identify subtle anomalies. Leveraging the transformer architecture, the STATE model captures long-range dependencies in video sequences, thereby improving performance in complex and dynamic scenes. Its unique approach to anomaly detection through reconstruction errors has proven highly effective, surpassing many traditional models in precision and recall.\n\nSimilarly, the Grid HTM model represents a hierarchical temporal memory system tailored for video anomaly detection [3]. This model is adept at handling noise and performing online learning, making it ideal for real-time applications. The Grid HTM model\u2019s ability to memorize and recognize normal patterns over extended periods enables more accurate anomaly detection. Moreover, its online learning capability ensures adaptability to changing environments, maintaining high detection rates even when underlying patterns shift.\n\nImprovements in feature extraction and representation learning have also played a crucial role in refining anomaly detection processes. Techniques such as memory modules, compactness/separateness losses, and cross-branch feed-forward networks have been employed to enhance anomaly scores and detection accuracy. Memory modules help in learning and retaining normal patterns, mitigating overfitting risks and enhancing generalization capabilities [1]. Compactness/separateness losses ensure that learned representations are compact and easily separable, facilitating better distinction between normal and anomalous behaviors. By optimizing these losses, models capture the intricacies of normal behavior more effectively, reducing false positives and improving detection accuracy.\n\nCross-branch feed-forward networks, by integrating spatial and temporal features, provide a more holistic view of video sequences, aiding in the precise localization of anomalies [3]. This approach addresses limitations of traditional single-stream methods, offering a more comprehensive understanding of video content.\n\nFurthermore, the integration of self-supervised learning techniques has bolstered advancements in video anomaly detection. Self-supervised learning, which does not require explicit labeling of anomalies, facilitates model operation in environments with limited labeled data. Strategies such as SiT (Self-supervised vIsion Transformer), Mix-up, and MOCA enhance feature discrimination and robustness, improving anomaly detection systems [1].\n\nThese advancements represent a significant leap forward, showcasing the growing sophistication of deep learning models and their increasing capability to address complex real-world scenarios. However, despite these achievements, unresolved issues such as noise, concept drift, and extensive labeled data requirements continue to pose challenges. Addressing these will require further innovation and interdisciplinary collaboration.\n\nIn conclusion, the current landscape of deep learning for video anomaly detection highlights remarkable progress driven by novel architectures and advanced feature extraction techniques. The introduction of models like the STATE and Grid HTM opens new avenues for accurate and adaptable anomaly detection systems. Concurrent improvements in feature learning contribute to more robust and reliable detection outcomes. Nonetheless, the pursuit of perfect anomaly detection remains ongoing, necessitating further exploration and refinement of existing methodologies.\n\n### 8.2 Unresolved Issues and Limitations\n\nDespite significant progress in deep learning for video anomaly detection, several unresolved issues and limitations persist that hinder the widespread adoption and effectiveness of these models. Handling noise, concept drift, and the reliance on extensive labeled data remain among the most pressing challenges. These issues not only affect the performance and robustness of existing models but also complicate the deployment of anomaly detection systems in real-world scenarios.\n\nNoise poses a substantial challenge in video anomaly detection. Unlike static images, videos are inherently more complex due to their temporal dynamics and varying lighting conditions. Noise can manifest in various forms, such as compression artifacts, occlusions, and camera jitter, all of which can significantly distort video content and lead to false positive detections [1]. Deep learning models, particularly those employing generative models like GANs and autoencoders, are often susceptible to noise, as they might misinterpret noisy data as anomalies. For instance, the authors of \"Grid HTM Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Anomaly Detection in Videos\" argue that traditional deep learning approaches, despite their powerful feature learning capabilities, are generally poor at handling noise. They suggest that noise can interfere with the learning process, making it difficult for the model to distinguish between actual anomalies and noise-induced variations.\n\nConcept drift represents another critical challenge. Concept drift refers to the gradual change in the underlying distribution of data over time, which can lead to model degradation and reduced performance [1]. In video anomaly detection, this issue is particularly relevant as the behavior captured in surveillance footage can evolve due to changes in environment, lighting conditions, or the presence of new objects. Traditional deep learning models typically require retraining or fine-tuning to adapt to these changes, which can be cumbersome and time-consuming. The \"Grid HTM Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Anomaly Detection in Videos\" paper highlights the importance of models that can handle concept drift effectively, such as HTM, which possesses strong noise tolerance and supports online learning, thereby enabling continuous adaptation to changing conditions.\n\nMoreover, the requirement for extensive labeled data remains a significant limitation in deep learning-based video anomaly detection. While unsupervised and semi-supervised approaches have alleviated some dependency on labeled data, they still face challenges in accurately representing the full spectrum of normal behavior [1]. The lack of comprehensive labeled data can lead to underrepresentation of certain types of anomalies, thereby affecting the model\u2019s generalizability and reliability. For example, in the \"Making Reconstruction-based Method Great Again for Video Anomaly Detection\" paper, the authors emphasize the importance of having a diverse set of labeled data to train robust models. They note that limited labeled data can result in overfitting to the training set, leading to poor performance on unseen data. This issue is compounded by the inherent difficulty in labeling large volumes of video data accurately and consistently.\n\nHandling unknown anomalies also presents a significant challenge. Traditional supervised learning approaches struggle when encountering anomalies that were not present in the training data, as these models are trained to recognize specific patterns associated with known anomalies [3]. The authors of \"Video Anomaly Detection by Estimating Likelihood of Representations\" propose a deep probabilistic model that estimates the likelihood of representations, thereby enabling the detection of previously unseen anomalies. However, such models still face difficulties in generalizing to entirely novel anomalies that do not conform to learned distributions. This limitation underscores the need for models that can better generalize and adapt to unforeseen scenarios.\n\nThe issue of heterogeneity is another complicating factor in video anomaly detection. Anomalies can vary greatly in terms of their duration, intensity, and manifestation across different scenarios. For instance, anomalies in a retail store setting may involve theft or shoplifting, while those in a hospital setting might include unauthorized access to patient rooms. Capturing and effectively distinguishing between these diverse anomalies requires models that can accommodate the wide range of possible behaviors [20]. While recent advancements in deep learning have shown promise in addressing heterogeneity, there is still a long way to go in developing models that can handle the complexity and variability of real-world anomalies.\n\nFurthermore, the computational demands of deep learning models pose practical challenges in real-time anomaly detection systems. High computational costs associated with training and inference can limit the applicability of these models in resource-constrained environments, such as edge devices or low-power IoT sensors. For example, the \"Real-Time Anomaly Detection With HMOF Feature\" paper introduces a lightweight feature descriptor named Histogram of Magnitude Optical Flow (HMOF) to reduce computational complexity. Although this approach demonstrates promising results in real-time anomaly detection, it highlights the ongoing tension between computational efficiency and model performance.\n\nThe interpretability of deep learning models remains a significant concern. Despite the impressive performance of deep learning models, their opaque nature makes it difficult to understand the decision-making process behind anomaly detections. This lack of transparency can be particularly problematic in safety-critical applications where the ability to explain and justify detection decisions is crucial. Efforts to enhance the explainability of deep learning models are underway, but significant progress is needed to bridge the gap between model performance and interpretability [21].\n\nIn conclusion, while deep learning has brought transformative advancements to video anomaly detection, several unresolved issues and limitations persist. Addressing these challenges will require continued research and innovation in areas such as robust feature extraction, adaptive learning mechanisms, efficient data utilization, and improved interpretability. As the field continues to evolve, it is imperative to leverage interdisciplinary collaborations and cutting-edge technologies to overcome these obstacles and realize the full potential of deep learning in video anomaly detection.\n\n### 8.3 Potential Future Research Directions\n\nAs the field of deep learning for video anomaly detection continues to evolve, several promising research directions could significantly advance the capabilities of existing models and address current limitations. These include exploring multi-modal input integration, developing adaptive anomaly detection models that can adjust to changing environments, and enhancing explainability in deep learning models.\n\nExploring the integration of multi-modal inputs into video anomaly detection systems represents a compelling avenue for future research. Multi-modal data includes various types of sensory inputs such as audio, thermal imaging, and motion sensors. By incorporating these diverse modalities, models can gain a more comprehensive understanding of the environment, thereby improving their ability to detect anomalies in complex and dynamic settings. For instance, audio signals can complement visual cues in identifying events that might not be visually apparent, such as subtle sounds preceding an anomaly. Similarly, thermal imaging can provide additional information about temperature changes that may indicate abnormal activities. Leveraging multi-modal inputs can enhance detection accuracy and robustness, contributing to more reliable anomaly detection systems [12].\n\nDeveloping adaptive anomaly detection models that can adjust to changing environments is crucial for real-world applications. Traditional models often require extensive retraining when the environment changes, leading to increased computational costs and delays. Adaptive models, however, can dynamically adjust their parameters and learning strategies based on evolving conditions. Online learning mechanisms can continuously update the model's weights as new data becomes available, ensuring the model remains up-to-date with the latest trends in the data distribution. Additionally, transfer learning techniques can facilitate the reuse of pre-trained models across different but similar environments, reducing the need for large amounts of labeled data in each setting. These approaches enhance the adaptability of anomaly detection systems and reduce dependency on constant human supervision [14].\n\nEnhancing the explainability of deep learning models in video anomaly detection is essential for building trust and facilitating adoption in critical applications. Deep learning models are often criticized for their black-box nature, which makes it difficult to understand how they arrive at their decisions. This opacity can be particularly problematic in domains such as surveillance and security, where accountability and transparency are paramount. To address this, researchers can focus on developing more interpretable models that provide clear explanations for their predictions. Methods such as saliency maps can highlight the parts of the video sequence that contribute most to the anomaly score, thereby offering insights into the reasoning process of the model. Incorporating explicit reasoning mechanisms into the model architecture, such as attention mechanisms, can also help identify which features are most influential in the detection process. Such enhancements improve transparency and aid in debugging and fine-tuning [16].\n\nMoreover, integrating domain-specific knowledge in designing anomaly detection models presents another promising direction. Prior knowledge about the environment, such as typical patterns of activity and common anomalies, can guide the learning process and improve the model\u2019s performance. For example, incorporating prior knowledge about typical pedestrian movements in a surveillance camera feed can help the model better distinguish between normal and anomalous behaviors. Similarly, using domain-specific rules and constraints can enhance the robustness of the model against certain types of anomalies. This approach aligns with the concept of knowledge-guided data-centric AI, emphasizing the importance of leveraging expert knowledge to improve data representation and model outcomes [17].\n\nAdditionally, exploring hybrid models that combine the strengths of both supervised and unsupervised learning offers significant potential. Supervised approaches rely on labeled data, which can be scarce and expensive to obtain, while unsupervised methods do not require labels but may struggle with detecting subtle anomalies. Hybrid models can leverage the benefits of both paradigms by initially training the model in an unsupervised manner to learn general patterns and then fine-tuning it with a small amount of labeled data to capture domain-specific nuances. This two-step process reduces the reliance on large labeled datasets and enhances the model's ability to generalize across different scenarios [15].\n\nFurthermore, the development of efficient and scalable deep learning models is crucial for practical deployment in real-world settings. Current models are often computationally intensive, requiring significant resources for inference and training, which limits their applicability in resource-constrained environments. Designing lightweight architectures that maintain high performance while reducing computational overhead is therefore essential. Techniques such as pruning, quantization, and model compression can be employed to create more efficient models. Additionally, integrating hardware accelerators like GPUs and TPUs can enhance computational efficiency. Ensuring models are both accurate and efficient broadens their applicability across various platforms and environments [13].\n\nAddressing the challenges of real-time anomaly detection in video streams is a critical area for future research. Real-time processing requires models to perform detections rapidly and accurately amid the high volume and velocity of video data. Techniques such as streaming analytics and incremental learning enable models to process and learn from data in real-time, ensuring anomalies are detected promptly. Developing distributed systems that handle large-scale video streams across multiple nodes improves the scalability and reliability of real-time anomaly detection systems. Focusing on these areas paves the way for more effective and timely anomaly detection in video streams, enhancing the overall security and efficiency of surveillance and monitoring systems [28].\n\nIn conclusion, the future of deep learning for video anomaly detection holds immense promise. By exploring multi-modal input integration, developing adaptive models, enhancing explainability, leveraging domain-specific knowledge, creating efficient hybrid models, and addressing real-time processing challenges, researchers can unlock new opportunities and overcome existing limitations. These advancements improve the performance and reliability of anomaly detection systems and broaden their applicability across various domains. As the field continues to grow, interdisciplinary collaboration between computer scientists, statisticians, and domain experts will be essential for driving innovation and achieving meaningful breakthroughs in video anomaly detection.\n\n### 8.4 Importance of Interdisciplinary Collaboration\n\nThe pursuit of advancements in video anomaly detection through deep learning has necessitated the convergence of expertise from multiple disciplines. While rooted in computer science, particularly in machine learning and computer vision, video anomaly detection increasingly relies on insights from statistics, signal processing, and domain-specific knowledge to address the complexities of real-world applications. Collaborative efforts between computer scientists, statisticians, and domain experts are pivotal for both driving innovation and tackling the intricate challenges posed by video anomaly detection.\n\nOne of the primary reasons for fostering interdisciplinary collaboration is to address the multifaceted nature of anomaly detection in video streams. These streams often contain rare and unpredictable events amidst normal behavior, making the problem inherently complex. Different application scenarios, such as surveillance systems, traffic monitoring, and industrial processes, each introduce unique challenges that require tailored solutions, highlighting the need for specialized knowledge from domain experts.\n\nThe statistical foundation of anomaly detection plays a crucial role in ensuring the reliability and robustness of deep learning models. Traditional anomaly detection approaches frequently rely on statistical methods to define normality and identify deviations. Integrating these methods with deep learning requires a nuanced understanding of both domains. For instance, the use of compactness and separateness losses, as discussed in 'A Survey on Deep Learning Techniques for Video Anomaly Detection', demands a sophisticated understanding of statistical principles to ensure that the learned representations effectively capture the essence of normal behavior while distinguishing anomalies. Statisticians contribute invaluable expertise in formulating these losses and optimizing the models for better performance.\n\nBeyond mere algorithmic performance, the deployment of deep learning models for video anomaly detection requires consideration of efficiency, interpretability, and adaptability to varying environmental conditions. Computer scientists, with their knowledge of deep learning architectures and optimization techniques, collaborate with statisticians to develop models that meet these criteria. The development of Grid HTM, as described in 'Grid HTM: Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Anomaly Detection in Videos', exemplifies this collaboration, integrating principles from both domains to create a model robust to noise and capable of online learning.\n\nThe interpretability of deep learning models remains a significant challenge, especially in critical applications such as security and surveillance. Lack of transparency can hinder trust and adoption, particularly where human oversight is necessary. Domain experts, with their deep understanding of specific application contexts, ensure that models are not only technically sound but also comprehensible and trustworthy. For example, the exploration of probabilistic approaches to estimate the likelihood of video representations, as mentioned in 'A Unifying Review of Deep and Shallow Anomaly Detection', underscores the need for models that offer insights into the decision-making process. Collaborative efforts facilitate the integration of these probabilistic frameworks with deep learning, enhancing model explainability.\n\nInterdisciplinary collaboration also drives progress in addressing specific challenges unique to video anomaly detection. Scarcity of annotated data, a common bottleneck in training deep learning models, poses significant limitations, particularly in unsupervised and semi-supervised settings. Researchers from different backgrounds collaborate to develop innovative solutions, such as semi-supervised learning strategies that leverage unlabeled data to improve model performance. The use of self-supervised learning techniques, as discussed in 'Deep Video Anomaly Detection: Opportunities and Challenges', illustrates the potential of integrating domain-specific insights with statistical methods to enhance model robustness.\n\nFinally, the development of scalable and deployable solutions for video anomaly detection is critical, given the rise of IoT and edge computing. Lightweight, efficient models that can operate in resource-constrained environments are essential. For instance, the adaptation of pre-trained models and feature extraction techniques for real-time anomaly detection on edge devices, as demonstrated in 'Video Anomaly Detection Using Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Nets and Context Mining', highlights the importance of collaboration between computer scientists and domain experts to ensure feasibility in practical settings.\n\nIn conclusion, the evolution of deep learning for video anomaly detection has greatly benefited from interdisciplinary collaboration. By combining the expertise of computer scientists, statisticians, and domain experts, researchers can address the multifaceted challenges inherent in this domain, driving innovation and ensuring that developed solutions are effective and applicable in real-world scenarios. Continued engagement from experts across these fields will undoubtedly propel the field towards new horizons, solidifying its role as a cornerstone of intelligent surveillance and monitoring systems.\n\n### 8.5 Exploring New Trends\n\nAs video anomaly detection continues to evolve, several emerging trends and technologies are reshaping the landscape of this field, offering new opportunities and challenges. Notably, the application of transformer networks and vision transformers stands out as a prominent direction, with transformative potential for self-supervised learning paradigms. These advancements are expected to significantly enhance the performance and flexibility of anomaly detection models, particularly in handling complex and varied video sequences.\n\nTransformers, initially developed for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, have demonstrated exceptional success in capturing long-range dependencies and handling sequential data. The introduction of Vision Transformers (ViTs) has extended this success to computer vision tasks, including video anomaly detection. ViTs leverage a self-attention mechanism to learn hierarchical representations of video sequences, enabling them to effectively capture both spatial and temporal dynamics. This capability is crucial for tasks requiring a deep understanding of complex patterns and relationships, such as anomaly detection.\n\nOne of the key advantages of transformers lies in their ability to perform self-supervised learning (SSL) without the need for extensive labeled data. SSL involves training models on large amounts of unlabeled data, utilizing inherent structures and patterns within the data to learn meaningful representations. For video anomaly detection, this approach significantly reduces the reliance on manually annotated datasets, which are often labor-intensive and costly to produce. ViTs, due to their strong feature extraction capabilities, can be fine-tuned on small labeled datasets following pretraining on large unlabeled datasets, potentially leading to more robust and adaptable models.\n\nRecent studies have showcased promising results in applying transformers and ViTs to video anomaly detection. For instance, the study titled \"Towards Video Anomaly Retrieval from Video Anomaly Detection New Benchmarks and Model\" proposes a novel task called Video Anomaly Retrieval (VAR), which leverages transformers to retrieve relevant anomalous videos using detailed descriptions. The model, named Anomaly-Led Alignment Network (ALAN), employs an anomaly-led sampling technique to focus on key segments within long untrimmed videos and an efficient pretext task to enhance semantic associations between video and text representations. This approach highlights the potential of transformers in integrating multimodal information, which is particularly beneficial for complex and diverse video datasets.\n\nAnother notable trend is the exploration of open-vocabulary video anomaly detection (OVVAD), which aims to detect and categorize both seen and unseen anomalies using pre-trained large models. This approach leverages the capacity of transformers to handle a broad vocabulary of anomaly types, making it more versatile for real-world applications where anomaly categories may not be predefined. The study \"Open-Vocabulary Video Anomaly Detection\" introduces a model that decomposes OVVAD into class-agnostic detection and class-specific classification tasks, optimizing both tasks simultaneously. This decomposition enables the model to first detect anomalies without specifying categories and then classify them based on learned representations. The authors also introduce a semantic knowledge injection module and an anomaly synthesis module to enhance the model's capability in handling unseen anomalies.\n\nFurthermore, the use of transformers and ViTs in video anomaly detection addresses longstanding challenges such as concept drift and the need for extensive labeled data. Concept drift occurs when the underlying patterns in data change over time, presenting significant difficulties for traditional anomaly detection models. By continuously learning from new data, transformers can adapt to evolving patterns more effectively, thus mitigating the impact of concept drift. Additionally, the ability of transformers to generalize from small amounts of labeled data to large volumes of unlabeled data alleviates the burden of collecting and annotating large datasets, making anomaly detection more feasible in resource-constrained environments.\n\nHowever, the adoption of transformers and ViTs in video anomaly detection also presents several challenges. A primary concern is the computational demand associated with these models. Transformers typically require substantial computational resources due to their reliance on self-attention mechanisms, which involve computing attention scores for every pair of tokens in the sequence. For video anomaly detection, this translates to significant computational overhead, especially for high-resolution video streams. Addressing this issue necessitates innovative approaches such as model pruning, quantization, and the development of more efficient attention mechanisms. Researchers are actively exploring these avenues to make transformers and ViTs more deployable in real-world applications.\n\nAnother challenge is the interpretability of transformer-based models, which can be less transparent compared to simpler architectures. This lack of transparency can be problematic in safety-critical applications such as surveillance, where understanding and justifying model decisions is essential. Recent advancements in explainable AI (XAI) techniques are beginning to address this issue, providing methods to visualize and interpret the decision-making processes of transformers. For instance, techniques such as saliency maps and attention visualization can offer insights into which parts of the video drive anomaly predictions, thereby enhancing trust and usability in practical deployments.\n\nIn summary, the integration of transformer networks and vision transformers into video anomaly detection represents a promising avenue for advancing the state of the art in this field. By leveraging their powerful feature extraction and representation learning capabilities, these models can enable more accurate, flexible, and adaptable anomaly detection systems. As the field continues to evolve, addressing the computational and interpretability challenges will be crucial for fully realizing the potential of these technologies in real-world applications. Ongoing research and development in these areas hold great promise for transforming video anomaly detection into a more robust and versatile tool for various domains.\n\n\n## References\n\n[1] Deep Video Anomaly Detection  Opportunities and Challenges\n\n[2] Video Anomaly Detection for Smart Surveillance\n\n[3] Generalized Video Anomaly Event Detection  Systematic Taxonomy and  Comparison of Deep Models\n\n[4] An overview of deep learning based methods for unsupervised and  semi-supervised anomaly detection in videos\n\n[5] Adversarial Machine Learning Attacks Against Video Anomaly Detection  Systems\n\n[6] TeD-SPAD  Temporal Distinctiveness for Self-supervised  Privacy-preservation for video Anomaly Detection\n\n[7] Understanding the Challenges and Opportunities of Pose-based Anomaly  Detection\n\n[8] Hybrid Deep Network for Anomaly Detection\n\n[9] Grid HTM  Hierarchical Temporal Memory for Anomaly Detection in Videos\n\n[10] CHAD  Charlotte Anomaly Dataset\n\n[11] Video Anomaly Detection Using Pre-Trained Deep Convolutional Neural Nets  and Context Mining\n\n[12] Unveiling the frontiers of deep learning  innovations shaping diverse  domains\n\n[13] Integration and Performance Analysis of Artificial Intelligence and  Computer Vision Based on Deep Learning Algorithms\n\n[14] Automated Deep Learning  Neural Architecture Search Is Not the End\n\n[15] A Review of Deep Learning with Special Emphasis on Architectures,  Applications and Recent Trends\n\n[16] P2ExNet  Patch-based Prototype Explanation Network\n\n[17] Knowledge-Guided Data-Centric AI in Healthcare  Progress, Shortcomings,  and Future Directions\n\n[18] A Lightweight Video Anomaly Detection Model with Weak Supervision and  Adaptive Instance Selection\n\n[19] Divide and Conquer in Video Anomaly Detection  A Comprehensive Review  and New Approach\n\n[20] Video Anomaly Detection by Solving Decoupled Spatio-Temporal Jigsaw  Puzzles\n\n[21] Multi-Contextual Predictions with Vision Transformer for Video Anomaly  Detection\n\n[22] Making Reconstruction-based Method Great Again for Video Anomaly  Detection\n\n[23] Real-Time Anomaly Detection With HMOF Feature\n\n[24] Exploring Diffusion Models for Unsupervised Video Anomaly Detection\n\n[25] Real-world Anomaly Detection in Surveillance Videos\n\n[26] Anomaly Locality in Video Surveillance\n\n[27] Towards Video Anomaly Retrieval from Video Anomaly Detection  New  Benchmarks and Model\n\n[28] The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Learning in Artificial  Intelligence\n\n\n",
