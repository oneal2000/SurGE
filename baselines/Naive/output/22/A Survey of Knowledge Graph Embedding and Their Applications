**Introduction:**
The rapid evolution of knowledge graph embedding (KGE) has significantly impacted various fields, including artificial intelligence, natural language processing, and recommendation systems. KGE techniques map entities and relationships from knowledge graphs into continuous vector spaces, enabling efficient computation and reasoning over structured knowledge. This survey aims to consolidate knowledge from a vast array of studies to provide researchers with a coherent understanding of the current landscape of KGE. We examine the methodologies, applications, and challenges in KGE, highlighting key advancements and identifying future research directions.

**Methodologies and Contributions**

#### Traditional Embedding Models
Early models like TransE [1] laid the foundation for KGE by representing entities and relations as vectors in a low-dimensional space. These models typically use predefined functions to measure the similarity between entities and relations, facilitating tasks such as link prediction. However, these models often struggle with capturing complex relationships and semantic nuances.

#### Contextualized and Hierarchical Models
More recent models have incorporated contextual and hierarchical information to enhance the expressiveness of embeddings. For example, CoKE [2] leverages the Transformer architecture to learn dynamic, fully contextualized embeddings based on sequences of entities and relations. Similarly, HAKE [3] maps entities into polar coordinates to capture semantic hierarchies, improving the representation of complex relational structures.

#### Neural Network-Based Models
Neural network-based models like DistMult [4] and SimplE [5] use scoring functions to learn embeddings that satisfy specific constraints. These models often integrate attention mechanisms and graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to capture hierarchical structures and relational patterns. For instance, SHGN [6] leverages commonsense knowledge for story comprehension, while KGIN [7] uses auxiliary item knowledge to identify user intents in recommendation systems.

#### Integrating External Knowledge and Transferability
Recent research has emphasized the importance of integrating external knowledge and ensuring the transferability of embeddings across domains. Tools like KEEN Universe [8] and SPG frameworks [9] ensure efficient and effective application across domains, enhancing the scalability and practicality of KGE models.

**Applications**

#### Link Prediction
Link prediction is one of the primary applications of KGE. Models like HAKE [3] and Rce-KGQA [10] improve multi-hop relation prediction by modeling hierarchical structures and relational chains. These models enhance the accuracy and reliability of link prediction, making them invaluable for tasks such as knowledge base completion and semantic parsing.

#### Recommendation Systems
KGE has shown significant promise in recommendation systems. KGIN [7] and KGCN [11] demonstrate enhanced recommendation accuracy and explainability by integrating knowledge graphs. These models capture user preferences and item attributes more comprehensively, leading to more personalized and relevant recommendations.

#### Question Answering and Natural Language Processing
KGE enhances NLP tasks by providing rich contextual information. Models like SHGN [6] and KGIN [7] improve textual entailment and story generation by leveraging knowledge graphs. These models are particularly useful in tasks such as question answering, where the ability to reason over complex queries is crucial.

#### Explainability and Interpretability
There is a growing demand for models that provide explanations for their predictions. Techniques like interaction embeddings (CrossE) [12] and intent identification (KGIN) [7] address this need by generating explanations for predictions. These models enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of KGE models, making them more applicable in real-world scenarios.

**Common Themes and Trends**

#### Hierarchical Modeling
Models increasingly incorporate hierarchical structures to capture semantic relationships. Techniques like polar coordinate mapping (HAKE) [3] and hierarchical GCNs (NoGE) [13] are prevalent. These models enhance the representation of complex relational structures, leading to improved performance in tasks such as link prediction and recommendation.

#### Contextual and Auxiliary Information
Integrating contextual and auxiliary information enhances KGE model performance. Models like SHGN [6] and KGIN [7] leverage commonsense knowledge and auxiliary item knowledge to improve prediction accuracy. These models reflect the growing importance of broader context understanding in KGE.

#### Explainability and Interpretability
There is a rising demand for models that provide explanations. Techniques like interaction embeddings (CrossE) [12] and intent identification (KGIN) [7] address this need by generating explanations for predictions. These models enhance the transparency and trustworthiness of KGE models, making them more applicable in real-world scenarios.

#### Scalability and Transferability
Scalability and transferability are crucial for practical applications. Tools like KEEN Universe [8] and SPG frameworks [9] ensure efficient and effective application across domains. These tools facilitate the integration of KGE models into various applications, enhancing their practical utility.

**Conclusion**
This survey underscores the methodologies and applications of KGE, showcasing their potential to transform various fields. From traditional translation-based models to advanced neural network-based models, the evolution of KGE methodologies reflects the growing complexity and diversity of knowledge graphs. Addressing challenges such as hierarchical modeling, contextual information integration, explainability, and scalability will continue to advance KGE. Future work should refine these methodologies and expand their applications, driving the continued growth and impact of KGE in artificial intelligence and beyond.
