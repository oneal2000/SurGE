**Introduction:**
The rapid evolution of machine learning (ML) has enabled groundbreaking advancements in various domains, from healthcare to autonomous systems. However, the increasing complexity of these models has raised significant concerns regarding their interpretability and explainability. As ML models are increasingly deployed in critical applications, the demand for transparent and trustworthy systems has grown exponentially. This survey aims to consolidate knowledge from a vast array of studies to provide researchers with a coherent understanding of the current landscape of explainable machine learning, specifically focusing on the roles of abduction and argumentation. By examining the methodologies, findings, and implications of these studies, we identify common themes, trends, and future directions in the field of XML.

### Overview of Abduction and Argumentation in Explainable Machine Learning

#### Definition and Importance
Abduction refers to the process of forming hypotheses that best explain observed phenomena, while argumentation involves constructing and evaluating arguments to support or refute claims. In the context of XML, these concepts are crucial for enhancing the transparency and interpretability of complex ML models. By leveraging abduction, models can generate plausible explanations for their decisions, whereas argumentation allows for the validation and refinement of these explanations through logical reasoning.

#### Historical Context and Evolution
The integration of abduction and argumentation in XML has evolved significantly over the past decade. Initially, research focused primarily on developing methodologies for generating and validating explanations. More recently, there has been a shift towards integrating these reasoning forms with advanced ML frameworks, aiming to create more principled and user-centric approaches to explainability.

### Methodologies and Approaches

#### Abductive Reasoning and Argumentation
Research in this area has emphasized the application of abduction and argumentation to various stages of the ML pipeline. For instance, Kakas and Michael [1] highlighted the importance of abduction in data preparation and argumentation in handling uncertainty and inconsistency. Subsequent studies, such as Logic for Explainable AI [14], have further refined these approaches by presenting symbolic logic theories applicable to different classifiers.

#### Contextual Information
Incorporating contextual information is another critical aspect of XML. Studies like Position: Do Not Explain Vision Models Without Context [2] underscore the significance of context in explaining vision models, aligning with cognitive perspectives on context-based decisions [4]. Understanding context is vital for human-like reasoning in AI systems, enabling more nuanced and accurate explanations.

#### Counterfactual Explanations
Counterfactual explanations, which provide actionable insights by showing how changes in input features can alter model predictions, have gained considerable attention. Papers such as CX-ToM [5] and CADEX [7] explore the use of Theory of Mind and constrained adversarial examples, respectively, to generate more interactive and actionable explanations compared to static methods.

#### Interaction and Visualization
User interaction and visualization tools play a pivotal role in enhancing explainability. Tools like Interactive Naming [8] and ConceptExplainer [10] facilitate user interaction to refine and validate model explanations, promoting a user-centric approach. These tools enable users to engage more deeply with the model's decision-making process, thereby fostering trust and understanding.

### Advancements and Innovations

#### New Methodologies
Advancements in XML have led to the development of innovative methodologies such as Logic Explained Networks (LENs) [20] and inflated explanations [17]. LENs leverage logical reasoning to enhance transparency, while inflated explanations provide richer insights into model decisions. These innovations represent significant strides towards more intuitive and context-aware explanations.

#### Integrated Approaches
Integrated approaches that combine abduction, argumentation, and contextual information are becoming increasingly prevalent. For example, the Task and Explanation Network (TENet) framework [Sipper, 2021] integrates task completion with explanation generation, emphasizing the importance of providing justifiable explanations. Such integrations aim to create more robust and comprehensive explainability solutions.

### Implications and Future Directions

#### Challenges and Debates
Despite significant progress, several challenges remain in the field of XML. Key debates include balancing interpretability with model accuracy, standardizing evaluation frameworks, and addressing security concerns related to model manipulation. These challenges highlight the need for continued research and collaboration among researchers, practitioners, and policymakers.

#### Future Research Directions
Future research should focus on refining evaluation methods, developing more robust and user-friendly explanations, and exploring interdisciplinary approaches that integrate psychological, sociological, and computational perspectives. Additionally, the integration of abductive and argumentative reasoning with emerging ML paradigms, such as federated learning and edge computing, holds promise for advancing the field of XML.

### Conclusion

This survey compiles key contributions from a wide range of influential papers, highlighting innovative methodologies and promising future research directions. The common goal is to develop more intuitive, context-aware, and interactive explanations to bridge the gap between complex ML models and human understanding. By synthesizing insights from diverse studies, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of research in abduction and argumentation for explainable machine learning, paving the way for more principled and effective explainability methods.
