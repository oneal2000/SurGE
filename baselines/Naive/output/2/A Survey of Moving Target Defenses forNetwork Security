**Introduction:**
The rapid evolution of network security threats necessitates the development of proactive defense mechanisms capable of countering increasingly sophisticated attacks. Moving Target Defense (MTD) strategies, which involve continuously altering network configurations to create unpredictable environments, represent a significant advancement in this field. This survey aims to consolidate knowledge from a vast array of studies to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent understanding of the current landscape of MTDs. The paper examines various methodologies, implementation strategies, and evaluation frameworks, highlighting the challenges and opportunities in the continued evolution of MTDs.

**Methodologies and Implementation Strategies:**

#### Dynamic Obfuscation

Dynamic obfuscation is a cornerstone of MTD, designed to confuse attackers by introducing randomness and variability into network configurations. CHAOS [Wang et al., 2021] leverages Software Defined Networking (SDN) to selectively obfuscate hosts with varying security levels, ensuring critical services remain accessible while obscuring less critical ones. This approach enhances the unpredictability of the network environment, making it harder for attackers to map and exploit the network.

DOLOS [Pagnotta et al., 2021] integrates moving target defense techniques with cyber deception, creating a layered defense that combines randomization and diversification with the use of decoys. This dual approach not only increases the complexity for attackers but also mitigates the overheads associated with traditional MTD techniques.

#### Game-Theoretic Modeling

Game-theoretic models offer a structured framework for optimizing MTD strategies. The Spatial-Temporal Moving Target Defense [Li et al., 2021] proposes a Markov Stackelberg Game framework to determine the optimal sequences and timings for system configuration changes. This model accounts for the switching costs and the varying times required for attackers to exploit different configurations, providing a precise characterization of the defenderâ€™s decision-making process.

Strategic Network Inspection [Bahamondes & Dahan, 2021] introduces a network inspection game where defenders position detectors to minimize the expected number of undetected attacks. By leveraging column generation and multiplicative weights update algorithms, this approach efficiently computes near-optimal strategies for large-scale networks.

#### Integration with Emerging Technologies

The integration of MTD with SDN and Network Function Virtualization (NFV) technologies has enabled more flexible and efficient deployment of MTD strategies. CHAOS [Wang et al., 2021] leverages SDN to implement IP obfuscation, ports obfuscation, and fingerprint obfuscation, demonstrating significant reductions in information disclosure without impacting network performance.

Moreover, DOLOS [Pagnotta et al., 2021] utilizes multiple layers of isolation to integrate MTD techniques into production systems seamlessly. This approach ensures that the added security does not compromise the usability and performance of the network.

### Evaluation Frameworks and Metrics

Evaluating the effectiveness of MTD techniques is crucial for understanding their impact on network security and performance. The A Survey of Moving Target Defenses for Network Security [Sengupta et al., 2021] categorizes MTD evaluations based on qualitative and quantitative metrics. Qualitative metrics include risk analysis and performance costs, while quantitative metrics encompass confidentiality, integrity, availability (CIA), attack representation, Quality of Service (QoS) impact, and targeted threat models.

MTDSense [Moghaddam et al., 2021] highlights the importance of evaluating MTD against targeted attackers who are aware of the MTD's presence. By analyzing the footprints left in network traffic, MTDSense identifies when MTD has been triggered and proposes new update algorithms to minimize information leakage.

### Advancements and Innovations

Several papers introduce novel approaches to enhance the efficacy of MTD. For example, EI-MTD [Qian et al., 2021] proposes a dynamic defense mechanism for edge intelligence, utilizing differential knowledge distillation and Bayesian Stackelberg games to select robust models for service. This approach effectively counters black-box adversarial attacks without requiring substantial resources.

Morphence-2.0 [Amich et al., 2021] leverages out-of-distribution detection to power a scalable MTD system, introducing sufficient randomness in the model's decision function. This ensures that repeated or correlated attacks are significantly challenged, preserving accuracy on clean data while reducing attack transferability.

### Comparative Analysis

Comparative analyses across studies reveal distinct advantages and limitations of different MTD approaches. Dynamic approaches like live migration (Azab et al.) and network address mutation (Reti et al.) offer higher flexibility and unpredictability but may require more sophisticated monitoring and management systems. Static configurations, on the other hand, may be easier to implement but less effective against persistent threats.

The trade-off between security and performance is a recurring theme. Studies like Reti et al.'s and Chowdhary et al.'s suggest that careful optimization can mitigate performance overhead while enhancing security. Conversely, overly aggressive MTD strategies may introduce unnecessary complexity and resource consumption.

### Future Directions

Future research should continue to explore the integration of MTD with emerging technologies, such as AI and blockchain, to address new and evolving threats. Additionally, the development of standardized metrics and validation frameworks will be crucial for advancing the practical adoption of MTD in real-world scenarios.

### Conclusion

This survey synthesizes key contributions, methodologies, results, and implications from the reviewed papers on Moving Target Defense for network security. Common themes include the use of dynamic obfuscation, game-theoretic modeling, and integration with emerging technologies. These advancements highlight the evolving landscape of network security and underscore the potential of MTD in countering sophisticated cyber threats. Future research should continue to explore innovative MTD strategies, emphasizing practical deployment and robust evaluation frameworks.
