**Introduction:**
The rapid evolution of natural language processing (NLP) has significantly impacted various domains, including machine translation, text classification, and natural language understanding. As NLP models become increasingly complex, ensuring their transparency and reliability becomes paramount. Explanation-based human debugging (EBHD) aims to address this challenge by leveraging model explanations to enable human oversight and correction. This survey aims to consolidate knowledge from a vast array of studies to provide researchers with a coherent understanding of the current landscape of EBHD in NLP. We examine methodologies, common themes, and trends, and discuss future research directions.

**Common Themes and Trends:**

#### Interactive Debugging Frameworks
Several papers focus on developing interactive platforms that enhance human-in-the-loop debugging processes. **XMD** (Lee et al.) introduces an end-to-end framework that uses task- or instance-level explanations to guide model updates based on user feedback. Similarly, **FIND** (Lertvittayakumjorn et al.) offers a method for disabling irrelevant hidden features to correct biases in text classifiers. Both frameworks underscore the importance of user-friendly interfaces and real-time model adjustments. Other studies, such as *Fast Few-shot Debugging for NLU Test Suites* by Malon et al., emphasize the importance of incorporating human feedback to refine model performance and enhance explainability.

#### Visualization and User Interaction
Visualization and user interaction play a crucial role in making model behavior understandable. **LIT** (Tenney et al.) presents a platform that integrates local explanations, aggregate analysis, and counterfactual generation, enabling rapid exploration and error analysis. Another notable tool, **AllenNLP Interpret** (Wallace et al.), provides a flexible framework for interpreting NLP models, offering a suite of built-in interpretation methods and visualization components. Studies like *The Role of Interactive Visualization in Explaining (Large) NLP Models* highlight the potential of visualization in explaining complex NLP models, emphasizing the importance of user-centric design.

#### Model Interpretability and Explainability
There is a notable trend towards developing frameworks that enhance the interpretability and explainability of NLP models. **ERASER** (DeYoung et al.) introduces a benchmark for evaluating rationalized NLP models, aiming to assess how well the rationales provided by models align with human rationales. Another example is **Learning to Explain** (Barkan et al.), which presents a model-agnostic framework for providing post-hoc explanations for vision models, demonstrating significant improvements in explainability. *Towards Explainable NLP: A Generative Explanation Framework for Text Classification* by Liu et al. proposes a framework that generates fine-grained explanations alongside classification decisions.

#### Debugging Tools and Frameworks
The development of specialized debugging tools and frameworks stands out as another key theme. **ChatDBG** (Levin et al.) introduces an AI-powered debugging assistant that integrates large language models (LLMs) to enhance the capabilities and user-friendliness of conventional debuggers. Additionally, **A Knowledge-based Automated Debugger in Learning System** (Zin et al.) proposes a new knowledge-based automated debugger designed specifically for educational purposes, offering a user-friendly tool for students to self-debug their programs.

#### Synthetic Datasets and Formal Frameworks
Several papers explore the use of synthetic datasets and formal frameworks to understand the roles of explanation data in improving model performance. For instance, Hase and Bansal [1] introduce a synthetic dataset and formal framework to investigate how explanations can enhance model accuracy, particularly in tasks where models might already possess inherent knowledge. Their findings suggest that explanations are most beneficial as model inputs, achieving up to 95% accuracy in synthetic tasks, whereas baselines without explanation data fall short at around 65%.

#### Behavioral Testing and Evaluation
Behavioral testing has gained traction as a means to comprehensively assess model performance beyond traditional accuracy metrics. **CheckList** (Ribeiro et al.) and **SYNTHEVAL** (Zhao et al.) exemplify this trend by generating diverse test cases to identify model weaknesses. Meanwhile, **ExplainaBoard** (Liu et al.) extends the concept of leaderboards to include detailed diagnostics and comparisons of system performances, facilitating a deeper understanding of model behaviors.

#### Comparative Analysis
Comparative analysis reveals significant differences in the effectiveness of various approaches. For instance, while Hase and Bansal [1] emphasize the importance of using explanations as model inputs, other studies like Tang et al. [4] and Camburu et al. [20] highlight the utility of explanations in improving model performance across different tasks. Moreover, the interactive debugging tools like iNNspector [2] and visualization methods like Seq2Seq-Vis [18] offer complementary approaches to enhancing model interpretability.

### Methodological Approaches

#### User Feedback Integration
A recurring theme in the surveyed papers is the integration of user feedback into the debugging process. **XMD** (Lee et al.) and **FIND** (Lertvittayakumjorn et al.) emphasize the role of user-provided feedback in refining models, demonstrating significant improvements in out-of-distribution (OOD) performance. These frameworks illustrate how human insights can effectively mitigate spurious biases and improve model robustness.

#### Automated Error Analysis
Automated error analysis methods aim to systematically identify and characterize model errors. **Towards Automated Error Analysis** (Gao et al.) proposes a meta-learning approach to automatically generate interpretable rules that characterize errors, aiding in the understanding and improvement of NLP systems. This method demonstrates its efficacy in enhancing the performance of models like VilBERT and RoBERTa.

#### Comparative Evaluations
Comparative evaluations are essential for gauging the relative strengths and weaknesses of different models and approaches. **How not to Lie with a Benchmark** (Shavrina & Malykh) critiques the use of arithmetic mean in benchmark scoring, advocating for geometric and harmonic means to more accurately reflect model performance. This perspective highlights the need for nuanced evaluation metrics that account for task complexity and dataset characteristics.

### Advancements and Innovations

#### Novel Diagnostic Tools
The development of novel diagnostic tools represents a significant advancement in the field. **Thermostat** (Feldhus et al.) compiles a large collection of model explanations and analysis tools, democratizing access to explainability research. This extensive dataset, generated over thousands of GPU hours, significantly reduces redundant computations and enhances comparability and replicability.

#### Conversational Interfaces
Conversational interfaces offer a promising avenue for interactive debugging. **InterroLang** (Feldhus et al.) adapts a conversational explanation framework to the NLP domain, facilitating dialogue-based exploration of datasets and models. User studies indicate that such interfaces can enhance the perceived correctness and helpfulness of explanations, improving model debugging efficiency.

### Conclusion
This survey synthesizes key contributions, methodologies, and findings from 100 influential papers in the realm of explanation-based human debugging of NLP models. The papers collectively highlight the evolving landscape of model transparency, interactive debugging, and comprehensive evaluation. Future research may benefit from integrating these advancements to develop more robust and interpretable NLP systems, ultimately enhancing their reliability and utility in real-world applications.
