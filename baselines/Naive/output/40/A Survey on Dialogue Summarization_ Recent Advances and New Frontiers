**Abstract:**
This survey paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent advancements in dialogue summarization, synthesizing findings from 100 influential research papers published over the past decade. The paper highlights key methodologies, common themes, and challenges, offering insights into the current state of research and suggesting future directions for improvement. Dialogue summarization, a critical task for condensing conversations into concise summaries, faces unique challenges due to the unstructured and context-dependent nature of dialogues. The integration of advanced neural architectures, reinforcement learning, and multi-modal data has significantly enhanced the quality and relevance of generated summaries. However, ongoing challenges such as maintaining factual consistency, handling informal language, and ensuring transferability across domains continue to drive research efforts.

**Introduction:**
Dialogue summarization is a burgeoning field that aims to condense the essential information from conversations into concise summaries. This task is crucial for applications ranging from customer service and meeting minutes to media content curation and legal proceedings. The rapid advancement of natural language processing (NLP) and deep learning has led to substantial progress in dialogue summarization, enabling more accurate and context-aware summarization techniques. However, despite these advancements, several challenges remain, including handling informal language, maintaining factual consistency, and ensuring the transferability of models across different domains. This survey aims to consolidate knowledge from a vast array of studies to provide researchers with a coherent understanding of the current landscape and future research directions in dialogue summarization.

**Methodological Approaches**

Dialogue summarization has seen a proliferation of methodologies, each addressing specific challenges and contributing to the overall advancement of the field.

**Neural Network Architectures**
Several studies have leveraged neural network architectures to enhance the effectiveness of dialogue summarization models. For instance, Zhong et al. (2020) and Liu (2020) introduced neural extractive summarization systems that achieve state-of-the-art results on benchmark datasets. These models utilize advanced neural architectures such as BERTSUM and memory mechanisms to capture the essence of conversations more accurately. Additionally, the integration of reinforcement learning, as demonstrated by Paulus et al. (2017), enhances the coherence and readability of generated summaries by optimizing the summarization process through auxiliary training objectives.

**Abstractive Summarization Techniques**
Abstractive summarization, which involves generating summaries that paraphrase and restructure the original text, has also seen significant advancements. Zhang et al. (2020) adapted a state-of-the-art neural abstractive summarization model for multi-document summarization, achieving superior performance on benchmark datasets. Furthermore, Wang et al. (2020) introduced KATSum, a knowledge-aware abstractive text summarization model that integrates Knowledge Graphs to reduce factual errors and enhance coherence. These models demonstrate the growing sophistication of abstractive summarization techniques and their practical applications.

**Contextual Modeling and Attention Mechanisms**
Effective dialogue summarization requires capturing the context and nuances of conversations. Xiong et al. (2020) introduced memory mechanisms to standard sequence-to-sequence (seq2seq) models, enabling them to generate context-aware responses. Moritz et al. (2020) proposed dilated self-attention, which combines restricted self-attention with a dilation mechanism to capture multi-resolution context efficiently. These innovations emphasize the critical role of contextual modeling in improving summarization quality.

**Personalized and Interactive Summarization**
Personalization and interactivity are emerging as vital aspects of dialogue summarization. Ghodratnama et al. (2020) introduced Adaptive Summaries, an interactive concept-based summarization model that learns from users' feedback iteratively. This approach enables users to customize summaries according to their preferences, enhancing the relevance and utility of the summaries.

**Incorporating External Knowledge and Context**
Integrating external knowledge and context has been shown to improve the quality of dialogue summaries. Seungone Kim et al. (2020) proposed a framework called SICK that leverages commonsense inferences as additional context, enhancing the informativeness and consistency of generated summaries. Similarly, Zhengyuan Liu et al. (2020) introduced a topic-aware architecture to adapt pointer-generator networks for conversation summarization, addressing the challenges posed by the hierarchical structure of conversations.

**Challenges and Future Directions**

Despite significant progress, several challenges remain in the field of dialogue summarization.

**Maintaining Factual Consistency**
Ensuring factual consistency across summaries, especially in multi-party conversations, is a major challenge. Studies such as Muhammad Khalifa et al. (2020) and Seungone Kim et al. (2020) emphasize the need for more robust mechanisms to maintain accuracy. Huang et al. (2020) proposed fact-aware evaluation metrics and summarization systems to mitigate factual inconsistencies in abstractive summaries.

**Handling Informal Language**
Informal language poses significant challenges for dialogue summarization models. Techniques such as speaker name substitution, negation scope highlighting, and multi-task learning, as explored by Muhammad Khalifa et al. (2020), enhance the model's ability to understand and generate summaries that accurately reflect the nuances of conversational language.

**Scalability and Transferability**
Scalability and transferability are ongoing concerns. Yiran Chen et al. (2020) conducted an empirical study on cross-dataset evaluation, revealing the limitations of existing summarization models in handling diverse data distributions. Keneshloo et al. (2021) proposed a transfer reinforcement learning framework for text summarization, achieving state-of-the-art results on multiple datasets even with limited training data.

**Conclusion**

The field of dialogue summarization has seen significant progress in recent years, driven by innovative methodologies and the availability of specialized datasets. Key contributions include the explicit incorporation of coreference information, the handling of informal language, and the integration of external knowledge. However, challenges persist, particularly in ensuring factual consistency and enhancing model transferability. Future research should focus on addressing these issues to further advance the state-of-the-art in dialogue summarization. By synthesizing the insights from these 100 papers, this survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current landscape of dialogue summarization, highlighting both the achievements and the remaining frontiers in this exciting area of NLP research.
