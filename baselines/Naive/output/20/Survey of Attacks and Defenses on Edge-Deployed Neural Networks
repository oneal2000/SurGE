**Introduction:**
The rapid evolution of edge computing has led to a significant increase in the deployment of neural networks at the edge of computing infrastructures. This shift towards edge-deployed neural networks is driven by the need for low latency, enhanced privacy, and reduced energy consumption. However, this trend introduces new security challenges, particularly concerning adversarial attacks. Adversaries can exploit vulnerabilities in these models to manipulate outputs, leading to severe consequences in critical applications such as autonomous vehicles and medical diagnostics. This survey aims to consolidate knowledge from a vast array of studies to provide researchers and practitioners with a coherent understanding of the current landscape of attacks and defenses on edge-deployed neural networks.

**Main Sections:**

### 1. Overview of Edge-Deployed Neural Networks

#### 1.1 Definition and Significance
Edge-deployed neural networks refer to machine learning models deployed directly on edge devices, such as IoT sensors, mobile phones, and autonomous vehicles. These networks enable real-time data processing and decision-making without relying on cloud servers, thereby reducing latency and enhancing privacy. However, the deployment of neural networks on resource-constrained edge devices introduces unique security challenges, making them vulnerable to adversarial attacks.

#### 1.2 Challenges and Motivations
The primary challenges in securing edge-deployed neural networks include limited computational resources, real-time processing requirements, and the need for robust defenses against diverse attack vectors. Adversaries can exploit these vulnerabilities through various attack methods, ranging from simple perturbation-based attacks to sophisticated evasion techniques. Therefore, the development of robust and efficient defensive strategies is essential to ensure the reliability and security of edge-deployed neural networks.

### 2. Types of Adversarial Attacks

#### 2.1 Perturbation-Based Attacks
Perturbation-based attacks involve adding small, imperceptible perturbations to input data to mislead neural networks. Studies such as *Constrained Gradient Descent (CGD)* [1] and *Prompt-Agnostic Attacks* [2] demonstrate the effectiveness of these attacks in manipulating model outputs. These attacks are particularly challenging due to their ability to evade detection and their applicability across various types of neural networks.

#### 2.2 Evasion Attacks
Evasion attacks are designed to bypass defenses by subtly altering inputs to achieve desired outcomes. For example, *DIVA* [3] exploits differences in output between original and adapted models, while *Scale-Invariant Adversarial Attack (SI-PGD)* [4] ensures stability and effectiveness against rescaling logits. These attacks highlight the need for robust and adaptive defensive mechanisms that can handle diverse evasion strategies.

#### 2.3 Latency Attacks
Latency attacks target the timing of data processing to disrupt real-time operations. Research by *Chen et al.* [5] shows how latency attacks can significantly impact object detection in edge devices, underscoring the importance of latency-resilient defenses.

### 3. Defensive Mechanisms

#### 3.1 Robust Training Techniques
Robust training involves modifying the training process to improve model resilience against adversarial attacks. Studies like *ADE-Net* [6] and *Single-step Adversarial Training with Dropout Scheduling* [7] propose methods to enhance model robustness without compromising performance. These techniques lay the foundation for more secure edge-deployed neural networks by ensuring that models are trained to withstand adversarial perturbations.

#### 3.2 Lightweight Defenses
Lightweight defenses are essential for resource-constrained edge devices. *EdgeShield* [8] and *RobustEdge* [9] introduce efficient and universal frameworks that incorporate lightweight detection networks and attention-based adversarial detection methodologies. These defenses achieve impressive F-scores and significantly reduced computational costs, making them ideal for edge deployment.

#### 3.3 Moving Target Defenses (MTD)
Moving target defenses involve periodically changing the model's structure or parameters to prevent adversaries from identifying and exploiting vulnerabilities. *Morphence-2.0* [10] and *EI-MTD* [11] exemplify this approach by utilizing differential knowledge distillation and Bayesian Stackelberg games to create robust, small-sized member models. These mechanisms effectively prevent adversaries from selecting optimal substitute models for black-box attacks.

#### 3.4 Certified Defenses
Certified defenses provide formal robustness guarantees, ensuring that models are provably resistant to adversarial attacks. *Certified Defenses* [12] employ advanced techniques such as geometric reweighting and hypernets to enhance detection and resilience against adaptive adversaries. These methods offer a high level of assurance, making them valuable for mission-critical applications.

### 4. Common Themes and Trends

#### 4.1 Resource Constraints
Resource constraints are a significant factor influencing the design of both attacks and defenses. Due to limited computational power and memory, edge devices require lightweight and efficient defense mechanisms. This constraint drives the development of novel techniques that balance robustness with computational efficiency.

#### 4.2 Real-Time Processing
The need for real-time processing is another critical aspect of edge-deployed neural networks. Defenses must be capable of operating in real-time without significant delays, making lightweight and fast detection mechanisms essential. Techniques such as *Sardino* [13] and *ASP* [14] demonstrate how dynamic ensembles and fast adversarial attack generation can be achieved while maintaining processing frame rates.

#### 4.3 Advanced Techniques
The integration of advanced techniques, such as capsule networks, geometric reweighting, and hypernets, is gaining traction in both attacks and defenses. These techniques enhance detection capabilities and resilience against adaptive adversaries, pushing the boundaries of what is possible in securing edge-deployed neural networks.

### 5. Advancements and Innovations

#### 5.1 Enhanced Attack Techniques
Recent studies have introduced advanced attack techniques that challenge existing defenses. For instance, *Distributionally Adversarial Attack* [15] generates adversarial samples based on optimal adversarial-data distribution, leading to significant reductions in model accuracy. These attacks highlight the need for more sophisticated and adaptive defensive strategies.

#### 5.2 Innovative Defensive Mechanisms
Innovative defensive mechanisms, such as *EagleEye* [16] and *Securebox* [17], represent significant advancements in the field. *EagleEye* leverages the minimality principle of adversarial attacks to distinguish between genuine and malicious inputs, offering a robust and versatile solution. *Securebox* integrates Software-Defined Networking (SDN) to enhance network monitoring and management, illustrating the potential of hybrid cloud-edge architectures in securing edge deployments.

### 6. Implications and Future Directions

#### 6.1 Real-Time Adaptability
The importance of real-time adaptability cannot be overstated. Defenses must be capable of operating in real-time to protect edge-deployed neural networks effectively. Future research should focus on developing frameworks that can integrate multiple defensive mechanisms and operate efficiently on resource-constrained devices.

#### 6.2 Computational Efficiency
Computational efficiency is crucial for edge deployment. Lightweight and fast defenses are essential to ensure that models can operate in real-time without significant delays. Future research should prioritize the development of more efficient algorithms and techniques that can handle the computational constraints of edge devices.

#### 6.3 Integrated Defense Mechanisms
Integrated defense mechanisms that combine multiple defensive strategies are likely to be more effective than single-layer defenses. Future research should explore the integration of robust training, lightweight defenses, and moving target defenses to create comprehensive frameworks that can protect edge-deployed neural networks against a wide range of attacks.

### Conclusion
