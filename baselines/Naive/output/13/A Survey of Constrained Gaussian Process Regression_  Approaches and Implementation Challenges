**Introduction:**
The rapid evolution of Gaussian Process Regression (GPR) has significantly impacted machine learning and statistical modeling due to its inherent ability to provide probabilistic predictions and handle uncertainty effectively. Traditional GPR, however, faces challenges in scalability and computational efficiency, particularly when dealing with large datasets and complex constraints. To address these limitations, researchers have developed innovative methodologies that enhance the scalability, robustness, and applicability of GPR models. This survey aims to consolidate knowledge from a vast array of studies to provide researchers with a coherent understanding of the current landscape and future research directions in constrained GPR.

**Background and Significance**
Gaussian processes (GPs) are a class of non-parametric models that offer a flexible framework for regression and classification tasks. They provide a natural mechanism for quantifying uncertainty and are particularly useful in scenarios where data is scarce or noisy. However, the standard GP framework faces significant challenges when applied to large-scale datasets and scenarios requiring adherence to physical or logical constraints. These constraints are essential for ensuring that predictions are not only statistically sound but also physically plausible and logically consistent. The integration of constraints into GP models has thus become a critical area of research, driving the development of new methodologies and techniques.

**Methodologies and Contributions**

#### Sparse Variational Gaussian Process Regression
Sparse variational methods, such as those introduced by Burt et al. (2019, 2020), reduce the computational complexity of GP regression by employing a subset of inducing variables. These methods approximate the full GP posterior, achieving a balance between computational efficiency and predictive accuracy. The theoretical foundations established by these studies provide guidelines for selecting the appropriate number of inducing variables, ensuring that the approximation quality is maintained even as the dataset size increases.

#### Constraint Handling Techniques
Various approaches have been proposed to incorporate constraints into GP models. Swiler et al. (2021) outline a comprehensive framework for imposing a wide range of constraints, including positivity, monotonicity, convexity, differential equations, and boundary conditions. These constraints ensure that the model predictions adhere to known physical laws or logical boundaries, thereby improving reliability and interpretability. Additionally, Kındap & Godsill (2020) extend the GP framework to handle non-Gaussian behaviors, providing robust modeling capabilities for heavy-tailed distributions.

#### Advanced Kernel Techniques
Advanced kernel designs enhance the flexibility and robustness of GP models. Jain et al. (2020) introduce subset-of-data variational inference for deep Gaussian processes (DGPs), simplifying the training process while maintaining performance. Meanwhile, Kındap & Godsill (2020) leverage time-changed GPs to model non-Gaussian behaviors, demonstrating the potential of advanced kernel designs in handling complex data distributions.

#### Efficient Implementations
Efficiency in computation is crucial for practical applications of GPR. Low et al. (2021) present a low-rank-cum-Markov approximation (LMA) that combines a low-rank representation of the GP with a Markov approximation of the residual process, enhancing scalability and predictive performance. Allison et al. (2021) explore the robustness of GP nearest-neighbour (GPnn) predictions, showing that as dataset sizes increase, the relevance of model parameter accuracy diminishes, leading to efficient and accurate predictions.

#### Model Selection and Optimization
Effective model selection and optimization are vital for improving GP performance. Fischer et al. (2020) develop a framework for model selection using approximation set coding, offering a promising alternative to traditional methods. Warren et al. (2021) introduce Stein random features (SRFs) to approximate spectral measure posteriors, enhancing both kernel approximation and Bayesian kernel learning.

#### Handling High-Dimensional Data
Methods for handling high-dimensional data are essential for practical applications. Izmailov and Kropotov (2023) introduce a variational inducing input GPR classification method, reducing computational complexity. Fichera et al. (2023) propose a GPR technique that leverages implicit low-dimensional manifolds, demonstrating scalability to large datasets.

#### Robustness Against Non-Gaussian Noise
Robustness against non-Gaussian noise is critical for reliable inferences. Altamirano et al. (2023) present a robust and conjugate Gaussian process (RCGP) regression method, using generalized Bayesian inference to maintain closed-form updates under various noise conditions.

#### Integration of Advanced Techniques
Advanced techniques like normalizing flows and variational inference enhance GP capabilities. Yu et al. (2023) introduce convolutional normalizing flows for deep Gaussian processes, enabling flexible posterior distributions. Sendera et al. (2023) propose Non-Gaussian Gaussian Processes (NGGPs), leveraging normalizing flows to capture complex non-Gaussian distributions.

#### Theoretical Foundations and Applications
Theoretical foundations and practical applications are explored. Howard et al. (2023) apply Wilsonian renormalization to Gaussian processes, providing insights into feature learning in deep neural networks. Huang et al. (2023) present a provably convergent scheme for compressive sensing under random generative priors, demonstrating the effectiveness of deep generative models.

**Comparative Analysis**
The methodologies discussed vary in their approaches to handling constraints and improving computational efficiency. Sparse variational methods offer scalable alternatives to full GP regression, while constraint handling techniques vary in their strategies for ensuring physical plausibility. Advanced kernel designs and efficient implementations enhance the flexibility and robustness of GP models, making them more applicable in diverse fields.

**Advancements and Innovations**
Significant advancements include the development of efficient computational methods, such as iterative solvers and pivoted Cholesky preconditioning by Eriksson et al. (2023). Integrating advanced techniques like normalizing flows and variational inference enhances the model's ability to handle complex distributions, as demonstrated by Yu et al. (2023) and Sendera et al. (2023).

**Discussion**
The research in constrained GPR reflects a growing emphasis on scalability, robustness, and applicability. Sparse variational methods and efficient implementations enable the application of GPR to large-scale datasets, while advanced kernel designs and constraint handling techniques enhance model flexibility and reliability. Future research could further explore the integration of these methodologies to tackle even more challenging problems in data-driven modeling.

**Conclusion**
This survey highlights significant progress in constrained Gaussian Process Regression, covering a range of methodologies and applications. From robustness against non-Gaussian noise to efficient computational methods and advanced integration techniques, the contributions from the surveyed papers underscore the ongoing evolution of GPR towards more practical and versatile models. Future research should continue to explore the integration of these advanced techniques to further enhance the utility and applicability of GPR in real-world scenarios.
